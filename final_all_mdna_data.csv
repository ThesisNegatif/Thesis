.@0000002488.@AMD.@2018-02-27.@2017 was an important year for AMD as we launched a number of new high-performance products that re-shaped our product portfolio and improved our technology competitiveness. We launched more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs and experienced strong customer acceptance of our new products. We launched our first-generation AMD Ryzen™ desktop CPUs based on our entirely new “Zen” x86 CPU core architecture. We released our AMD Ryzen™ 7 desktop processors designed for PC gamers, creators and the enthusiast market. We also launched our high performance AMD Ryzen™ 5 desktop processors at a variety of price points with up to 6 cores and 12 threads of CPU processing in April 2017. We released our AMD Ryzen™ 3 desktop processors in July 2017 designed to bring “Zen” processing power to mainstream price points. In August 2017, we launched the Ryzen™ Threadripper™ family of high-end desktop processors. For the commercial market, we launched AMD Ryzen™ PRO desktop processors, based on the same “Zen” x86 core architecture. In October 2017, we announced AMD Ryzen 7 2700U and AMD Ryzen 5 2500U, our first mobile processors with Radeon™ Vega graphics, previously codenamed the “Raven Ridge” mobile APUs, for premium 2-in-1s, convertibles and ultra-thin notebook computers. AMD Ryzen 7 2700U and AMD Ryzen5 2500U processors combine the “Zen” x86 core architecture with Radeon™ Vega graphics in an SoC design. We also expanded our consumer and professional graphics offerings with new graphics solutions. We introduced the Radeon™ RX 500 series in April 2017, a new line of graphics cards based on second-generation “Polaris” architecture that provides additional performance. We also announced the “Polaris” architecture-based Radeon™ Pro Duo card designed for media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows. We launched our new “Vega” GPU architecture for the high-end gaming, professional, and datacenter markets.  We introduced our Radeon™ RX Vega family of GPUs for enthusiast gamers, Radeon™ Pro SSG for up to 8K video production, and Radeon™ Instinct MI25 for machine intelligence and datacenter markets. We also focused on improving our competitive position in the server and datacenter markets. In June 2017, we launched the AMD EPYC™ 7000 Series of high performance processors that have up to 32 high-performance “Zen” compute cores and are designed to support a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O workloads. Customer engagement with our EPYC™ processors continued to grow during the year. In October 2017, we announced the AMD Embedded Radeon™ E9170 Series GPU. The new processor is the first “Polaris” architecture-based AMD Embedded discrete GPU available in multi-chip module (MCM) format with integrated memory for smaller, power-efficient custom designs. Our financial results improved in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as the demand for our Computing and Graphics segment products increased. Net revenue for 2017 was $5.3 billion, an increase of 25% compared to 2016. Our operating income for 2017 improved to $204 million compared to an operating loss of $372 million for 2016. Our net income for 2017 improved to $43 million compared to a net loss of $497 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017 were $1.18 billion, down from $1.26 billion at the end of 2016. Principal amount of total debt as of December 30, 2017 was $1.70 billion, compared to $1.77 billion as of December 31, 2016. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2017-02-21.@As we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, we made progress towards strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance in 2016. Net revenue for 2016 was $4.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2015 net revenue of $4.0 billion. The increase in net revenue from 2015 was due to a 9% increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and a 5% increase in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher GPU sales, offset by lower microprocessor sales. Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2016, was 23% compared to 27% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $340 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2016 (the WSA Charge) related to the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement (the Sixth Amendment) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). Operating loss for 2016 was $372 million compared to a $481 million for 2015. This improvement in operating performance in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to an increase in net revenue described above, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, net and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the joint ventures in China that we formed with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC), partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to the WSA Charge. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses. Our operating expenses in 2016 decreased to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015, due to the absence of restructuring charges in 2016, partially offset by increased R&D expenses. In 2016, we continued to improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities. During the third quarter of 2016, we issued $690 million of common stock and $805 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes). We used the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and the 2.125% Notes to pay $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit and repurchase an aggregate principal amount of $796 million of our outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes), 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) and 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed the remaining $208 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Notes and as a result, we no longer have any 7.75% Notes outstanding. Total debt as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.4 billion, compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $785 million at December 26, 2015. During 2016, we continued to execute our roadmap by delivering a number of new products and technologies across our two business segments. In March 2016, we announced new additions to our desktop processor family, with the AMD A10-7890K APU designed to help enable smooth play of online games and the AMD Athlon X4 880K APU that features our "Excavator" x86 architecture. Also in March, we introduced the Radeon Pro Duo GPU with the LiquidVR SDK platform designed for many aspects of VR content creation: from entertainment to education, journalism, medicine and cinema. In May 2016, we introduced our mobile 7th Generation A-Series processors. Our 7th Generation A-Series processors are designed to provide productivity and entertainment performance with maximum mobility for consumers. Also in May, we introduced an AMD Multiuser GPU (MxGPU) for blade servers, the AMD FirePro S7100X GPU, designed to provide a “workstation-class” experience for up to 16 users. We launched our first GPU featuring our Polaris architecture, the Radeon™ RX 480 GPU, in June 2016. Our Polaris architecture features our latest 4th Gen Graphics Core Next (GCN), along with the latest display technology support and performance per watt capabilities, all based on a FinFET 14 process technology. In July 2016, we revealed our new Radeon Pro SSG GPU with the ability to expand GPU storage up to 1 terabyte (TB) and which is designed for media and entertainment professionals. We also announced our new Radeon Pro WX series GPUs, which are based on our Polaris architecture and designed for workstation professionals and creators. In August 2016, we introduced the new Radeon RX 470, targeted at high definition (HD) resolutions for gamers. Also in August 2016, we released the new Radeon RX 460 graphics card with an ultra-quiet cooling solution and sub-75W power footprint for mainstream and e-sports gaming. We announced two new AMD Embedded Radeon graphics cards, the AMD Embedded Radeon E9260 and the AMD Embedded Radeon E9550 discrete GPU products in September 2016. These GPUs bring our Polaris architecture to the embedded markets and are designed to elevate the level of GPU processing performance available to embedded customers. In October 2016, we announced the first PCs featuring 7th Generation AMD PRO APUs. These APUs are built for businesses and designed to deliver increased computing and graphics performance and improved energy efficiency. In connection with our plans to further sharpen our focus and operations on designing high-performance products, we entered into a definitive agreement to form two joint ventures with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME) in the third quarter of 2015. In April 2016, we completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.) and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of TFME to form two joint ventures (collectively, ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME’s affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. We received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in the ATMP JV. In February 2016, as part of our IP monetization strategy, we and THATIC formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). Our equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. The THATIC JV’s primary purpose is to support our expansion into the server product market in China. We also licensed certain of our intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. We will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In addition, we entered into a Sixth Amendment with GF during the third quarter of 2016. The Sixth Amendment modifies certain terms of the wafer supply agreement applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Also, in connection with and in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) pursuant to which WCH received the right to purchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@ 0000002488.@AMD.@2016-02-18.@We faced a challenging business environment in 2015. The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed to a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease of 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an 8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above. Despite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6th Generation AMD A-Series mobile processors (formerly codenamed “Carrizo”) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU designed to support Windows® 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon™ R9 Fury X and R9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power efficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro™ server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170, designed for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and a unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both small and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and performance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay. With respect to our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media storage and communications and networking. During 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating expenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan). The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We realized operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $8 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $48 million in 2016. On October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Party’s affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2015 were $785 million compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. Total debt as of December 26, 2015 was $2.26 billion, compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014.
.@ 0000002488.@AMD.@2015-02-19.@Net revenue for 2014 was $5.5 billion, an increase of 4% compared to 2013 net revenue of $5.3 billion. The increase in net revenue from 2013 was due to a 51% increase in Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom segment revenue, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. The annual increase in Embedded, Enterprise and Semi-Custom segment net revenue was offset by a 16% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment net revenue. The annual decrease in the Computing and Graphics segment was primarily due to lower desktop processor and chipset sales. While we believe the pace of the decline in the PC market is slowing, our annual Computing and Graphics segment results reflect the ongoing challenges of a competitive consumer PC market. During 2014, as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. By the end of 2014, we derived approximately 40% of our annual revenues from high-growth markets. In the second quarter of 2014, we announced our ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom high-performance ARM and x86 processor cores for 2016. At the same time, we publicly demonstrated the AMD Opteron™ A1100 Series, our first 64-bit ARM-based server processor based on 28 nanometer (nm) technology. During 2014, we continued to experience strong demand for our AMD semi-custom SoCs that are found in Sony PlayStation®4 and Microsoft Xbox One. We also launched a number of new embedded products during 2014, including the second-generation AMD Embedded R-series APU and CPU, the new x86 AMD Embedded G-Series SoC, the AMD Embedded G-Series CPU and the AMD Embedded Radeon™ E8860 GPU. We also continued to develop and introduce differentiated products in 2014. We expanded our notebook APU offerings in 2014 with the introduction of the AMD 2014 Performance Mobile APU designed for ultrathin and high-performance mobile PCs, the AMD Pro A-Series APU for commercial PCs and the third-generation AMD mainstream and low-powered mobile APU designed for commercial and consumer mobile devices. We also launched a number of graphics products in 2014, including the AMD Radeon™ R9 295X2 and AMD Radeon™ R9 285 designed for performance gaming. In 2014, we made progress in improving our balance sheet by re-profiling our debt maturity schedule. During 2014, we repurchased $487 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), reducing the outstanding aggregate principal amount to $42 million. We repurchased $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2017 (8.125% Notes). We also repurchased $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes) in open market transactions, and $25 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The repurchases of the 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes were funded with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. To assist us in financing these note repurchases, during 2014, we issued $500 million of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) and $600 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes). Total debt as of the end December 27, 2014 was $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion as of December 28, 2013. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 27, 2014 were $1.0 billion compared to $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2013.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2014-02-18.@During 2013, we focused on executing our three-phase transformation plan designed to restructure, accelerate and transform AMD to better align our business to the changing computing landscape and to position ourselves to take advantage of new opportunities in high-growth adjacent markets. As of the end of 2013, we completed the first two phases of our strategic transformation plan that we outlined in October 2012, achieving key milestones in our corporate and financial transformation. We completed the restructuring of our company, creating a more efficient business with significantly lower operating expenses. From the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, we decreased operating expenses by approximately 31%. We also launched new products in accordance with our product roadmap and ramped our new semi-custom design capabilities in 2013. In the first half of 2013, Sony announced that it would use a semi-custom APU based on our “Jaguar” CPU core and next-generation Radeon graphics in its PlayStation®4 game console system, and Microsoft announced that the Xbox One would feature an AMD semi-custom SOC product. We began shipping our AMD semi-custom SOCs in the second quarter of 2013 to support the launch of the PlayStation®4 and Xbox One in the fourth quarter of 2013. With respect to our graphics products, we launched our AMD Radeon R7 and R9 series desktop graphics cards designed for enthusiast gamers, and we launched our AMD Radeon R7, R9 and R5 M200 series mobile discrete graphics processors based on our Graphics Core Next architecture for notebook GPUs in October 2013. For the traditional PC market, we introduced several new client processors, including our next generation 2013 AMD Elite Performance A-Series APUs, codenamed “Richland,” for premium ultrathin, traditional and performance notebooks and our AMD Elite Performance A-Series APUs for desktop PCs. We also launched our next generation 2013 AMD Mainstream quad-core x86 SOC, codenamed “Kabini,” designed for entry-level and small-form factor touch notebooks and our 2013 AMD Elite Mobility SOC, codenamed “Temash,” our first 28nm, quad-core x86 SOC designed for small form-factor notebooks, tablets and hybrids 13 inches and below. Net revenue for 2013 was $5.3 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to 2012 net revenue of $5.4 billion. Our operating income for 2013 improved to $103 million, compared to an operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2012. Our net loss for 2013 improved to $83 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 billion for 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, as of December 28, 2013 were $1.2 billion, the same as of December 29, 2012. The financial results for the second half of 2013 were evidence of our transformation efforts, as we derived more than 30% of net revenues from semi-custom and embedded products. During the second half of 2013, we also began laying the foundation for execution of the third phase of our transformation plan, in which we intend to expand our business beyond a transitioning traditional PC industry by creating a more diverse product portfolio and expanding our revenue base into new high-growth adjacent markets. We seek to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2013-02-21.@2012 was a challenging year for our industry and for AMD. The significant macroeconomic issues and unprecedented level and pace of change occurring across the industry magnified the challenges in our business and negatively impacted our 2012 financial results. In the second half of 2012, in particular, broader macroeconomic issues and changing PC dynamics impacted demand for end-user PC products. Weakness in the global economy, a reluctance on the part of OEMs to build inventory in advance of Microsoft’s Windows 8™ launch and the increasing popularity of tablets as a consumer device of choice contributed to the challenging business environment. As a result, we faced a difficult selling environment, which adversely affected our 2012 financial performance. Net revenue for 2012 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 17% compared to 2011 net revenue of $6.6 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2012 was 23% compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 included the following charges, which resulted in a negative impact of 22% in 2012: a $273 million Lower Cost or Market (LCM) charge, a $703 million charge related to a limited waiver of exclusivity from GF and a $5 million charge related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF, primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets, and a $5 million charge related to a legal settlement. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 41% in 2012 compared to 45% in 2011. Gross margin in 2012 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $100 million during the third quarter of 2012 as a result of lower than anticipated future demand for certain products as well as lower average selling price for microprocessor products due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions described above. Our operating loss for 2012 was $1.06 billion compared to operating income of $368 million in 2011. Our net loss for 2012 was $1.18 billion compared to net income of $491 million for 2011. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including long-term marketable securities, as of December 29, 2012 were $1.2 billion compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2011. As part of our strategy to respond to the macroeconomic issues and the changes occurring in our industry, during 2012, we made key strategic investments to align our business to a changing computing landscape and to position ourselves to take advantage of new opportunities in adjacent high-growth markets. In March 2012, we acquired SeaMicro, Inc. (SeaMicro), an energy-efficient, high-bandwidth micro-server company, to accelerate our strategy to deliver differentiated micro-server solutions to cloud data centers. In June 2012, we, along with ARM, Imagination Technologies, Media Tek, Qualcomm, Samsung and Texas Instruments established the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation, a non-profit consortium established to define and promote an open standards-based approach to heterogeneous computing. In October 2012, we announced that we will design 64-bit ARM® technology-based processors in addition to our x86 processors for multiple markets, starting with cloud and data center servers. We expect our first ARM technology-based processor will be a highly-integrated, 64-bit multicore system-on-a-chip optimized for the dense, energy-efficient servers. The first ARM technology-based AMD Opteron processor for servers is targeted for production in 2014 and is expected to integrate our AMD SeaMicro Freedom supercompute fabric. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring plan to improve our cost structure and enhance our competitiveness in core growth areas. This restructuring plan primarily involves a reduction of our global workforce of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We expect the restructuring action will result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $190 million in 2013. Further, to better align with today’s PC market dynamics, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA with GF. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 under the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to us during 2013 and through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, we committed to purchase a fixed number of production wafers at negotiated prices in the fourth quarter of 2012 and through December 31, 2013. GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration of this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a $273 million LCM charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee will be spread over several quarters, with $80 million that was paid by December 28, 2012 and $40 million payable by April 1, 2013. For the remainder of the fee, on the same date we entered into the third amendment, we issued a $200 million promissory note to GF that matures on December 31, 2013. Under the third amendment to the WSA, we committed to purchase from GF wafers for approximately $1.15 billion in 2013 and $250 million during the first quarter of 2014. We expect to negotiate the remainder of our 2014 purchase commitments from GF in 2013. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to focus on executing our engineering milestones. We launched our next AMD A-Series APU, codenamed “Trinity,” and our next generation AMD E-Series APU, codenamed “Brazos 2.0.” We also announced our AMD Z-60 APU, codenamed “Hondo,” our lowest powered APU designed for the performance tablet and small form factor PC market. We launched our AMD Opteron™ 3200, 4300 and 3300 Series server processor platforms based on our next-generation “Piledriver” core architecture. We announced AMD’s SeaMicro SM15000 server chassis, which extends fabric-based computing across racks and aisles of the data center to connect directly to large data storage systems. With respect to our graphics products, we launched our AMD Radeon™ HD 7950 graphics processor, and our AMD Radeon HD 7700 and 7800 series graphics processors, all based on 28nm process technology and designed for enthusiast desktop gamers.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2012-02-24.@In 2011, we experienced important changes in our business. First, we continued to develop and deliver differentiated products. We launched our AMD family of APU products and experienced strong customer demand, especially for our AMD E-Series and C-Series APUs designed for low-power desktop and mobile platforms, codenamed “Brazos,” and our AMD A-Series APUs, codenamed “Llano,” for mainstream desktop and mobile platforms. We introduced a number of competitive graphics products in 2011. In July 2011, we launched the AMD Radeon™ HD 6990M graphics processor designed for enthusiast mobile gamers. We also launched the AMD Radeon HD 7970 graphics processor in December 2011, our first graphics processor based on 28nm process technology and AMD’s Graphic Core Next Technology. We also continued to focus on improving our competitive position in the server market and believe we regained momentum in the second half of 2011 with the introduction of our new multi-core AMD Opteron™ 6200 and 4200 series processors, which are based on our “Bulldozer” x86 architecture. During 2011, we continued to focus on optimizing our financial model. In November 2011, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to strengthen our competitive positioning, implement a more competitive cost structure and conduct a workforce rebalancing to better address faster growing market segments. We expect that the restructuring plan will result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $118 million in 2012. We also implemented additional efficiencies across our operations, which we expect will save approximately $90 million in 2012 operating expenses in addition to the restructuring plan savings, resulting in more than $200 million of expected combined operational savings in 2012. We intend to use a significant portion of the anticipated savings to fund initiatives designed to accelerate our strategies for low power, emerging markets and the cloud. We also focused on improving our balance sheet. We reduced our outstanding debt by approximately $200 million principal amount in 2011, and we generated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, which we describe in more detail in the “Financial Condition – Liquidity” section below, of $528 million, a significant improvement compared to non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $355 million in 2010. However, our progress during 2011 was tempered by supply constraints related to our 32nm microprocessor products. We took steps during the course of the year to better manage our relationships with our third-party wafer foundries, and during the second half of 2011, 32nm yields and performance have improved. Net revenue for 2011 was $6.6 billion, relatively flat compared to net revenue of $6.5 billion for 2010. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2011 was 45%, a 1% decrease compared to 46% in 2010. Gross margin in 2011 included a $24 million charge recorded in connection with a payment to GF, primarily related to certain GF manufacturing assets, and a charge of approximately $5 million related to a legal settlement. Gross margin in 2010 included a $69 million benefit related to the deconsolidation of GF. Absent the effects of these events, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, our gross margin would have been 45% in each of 2011 and 2010. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, we changed our method of accounting for our ownership interest in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. As a result, we no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2011-02-18.@Entering 2010, our most important goals were: to deliver winning platform products; to differentiate ourselves with our graphics technology; to launch the AMD Fusion family of APUs and to demonstrate the success of our financial and business models focusing on semiconductor design. In 2010, we delivered a number of new products. In April 2010, we launched our new mainstream and enthusiast desktop platforms, and in May 2010, we launched two notebook platforms targeted at the mainstream market and the small and thin-and-light notebook market. At a time when visual computing is becoming an increasingly important part of the user experience, we introduced the industry’s first mobile graphics processor with Microsoft DirectX® 11 (DX 11) gaming support for notebook computers and extended this family of DX 11 capable graphics into the mainstream and value segments of the PC market. Also, for servers, we launched our AMD Opteron 6000 series and Opteron 4000 series platforms, targeting the performance and value conscious markets. At the end of 2010, we had more than 70 designs with the major OEMs. However, despite the number of systems, we did not have the volume of sales that we would have liked, and we expect to increase our focus on this opportunity in 2011. Also in 2010, although we experienced a delay in delivering our APU manufactured using 32nm technology, we shipped the first of our AMD Fusion family of APU processor products featuring our new x86 CPU core, codenamed “Bobcat.” On a macroeconomic level, consumer demand for end-user PC products grew in the first half of 2010, but the pace of that growth slowed in the second half of 2010. Despite the more challenging economic environment in the latter half of 2010, we were profitable in 2010. Our financial results improved in 2010 compared to 2009 as the demand for our Graphics and Computing Solutions segment products increased. Net revenue for 2010 was $6.5 billion, a 20% increase compared to net revenue of $5.4 billion for 2009, and during 2010, our sales in China and Japan increased significantly by $561 million and $255 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we deconsolidated GF, and began accounting for our investment in GF under the equity method of accounting. Entering 2011, we announced that we will be applying the cost method of accounting for our investment in GF, and will no longer recognize any share of GF’s net income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2010, we also made significant progress in improving our balance sheet by reducing our debt and adjusting our debt maturity schedule. Without taking into account GF’s debt, in the aggregate, we reduced our debt by approximately $357 million during 2010. Specifically, during 2010, we repurchased $1,016 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015 (6.00% Notes), reducing the outstanding aggregate principal amount to $780 million, and we issued $500 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes). Our debt and capital lease obligations as of December 25, 2010 were $2.4 billion, which reflects the debt discount adjustment of $103 million on our 6.00% Notes and 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2017 (8.125% Notes). This amount also includes approximately $229 million related to our accounts receivable financing arrangement with IBM, which is not a cash obligation and is described in more detail in the “Financial Condition –Liquidity” section below. Furthermore, GAAP net cash used in operating activities was $412 million. We also generated non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, which we describe in more detail in the “Financial Condition –Liquidity” section, of $355 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 25, 2010 were $1.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion at December 26, 2009, of which $904 million represented GF cash and cash equivalents. Without taking into account the GF financial position, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were essentially flat when compared to 2009.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2010-02-19.@Fiscal 2009 was a transformational year in which we emerged with a new business model focused on semiconductor design that leverages our technology portfolio of x86 microprocessor and graphics technologies. The credit market crisis and other macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy in 2008 continued and contributed to a challenging business environment for us during the first half of 2009. In particular, due to the credit markets and the reduced leverage in the economy, both business and consumer spending, including with respect to end-user products that incorporate our products, was at depressed levels during the first half of 2009. In light of the economic environment, one of our key priorities entering 2009 was to preserve cash and reduce operating expenses. To that end, in the first quarter of 2009 we continued to implement the cost reduction activities that we began in 2008 through additional headcount reductions, temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain employee benefits. During 2009, we also decreased our capital expenditures to $466 million compared to $621 million in 2008 and reduced our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. In March 2009, we formed GF, a manufacturing joint venture to which we contributed our front-end manufacturing assets, thereby significantly decreasing the cost-intensive burden of building and operating our own fabrication facilities. In the second half of 2009, end user PC demand stabilized. During this time we delivered visually-rich platforms, higher-performance six-core server processors and industry-leading graphics products. In an improving global macroeconomic environment, we saw increased customer and end user demand for our products, especially our six-core AMD Opteron processors for servers, which we introduced in June 2009 and our ATI Radeon 5000 series of GPUs, which we introduced in September 2009. We also settled the AMD-Intel litigation in November 2009, resulting in a new patent cross-licensing agreement, unprecedented ground-rules for fair competition in the microprocessor industry and a cash settlement of $1.25 billion for AMD. As economic conditions and our performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2009, we also restored salaries to pre-reduction levels, and in the first quarter of 2010, we will make a one-time payment to restore the full salary for the September through November 2009 period to all of our employees who participated in the salary reduction during that time. Net revenue for 2009 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 7 percent compared to 2008 net revenue of $5.8 billion. Net revenue in 2008 included $191 million of process technology license revenue related to the sale of 200 millimeter equipment. Excluding the favorable impact of this process technology license revenue, which we believe gives a more comparable view of net revenue, 2009 net revenue would have declined 4 percent compared to 2008 due to a 5 percent decrease in the net revenue of our Computing Solutions segment. The decrease in our Computing Solutions segment net revenue was due to a significant decrease in average selling price throughout 2009. Competitive market conditions and the macroeconomic challenges that affected the global economy during the first half of 2009 caused us to decrease the price of many of our Computing Solutions products and also contributed to a shift in our product mix to lower end microprocessors. However, buoyed by an improving economy and increasing demand for our products, net revenue of our Computing Solutions segment improved 39 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and 14 percent compared to the third quarter of 2009 due to a significant increase in unit shipments. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 42 percent in 2009, a 2 percentage point increase compared to 40 percent in 2008. Gross margin in 2009 included a $171 million, or 3 percent, benefit related to the sale of inventory that had been written-down in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin in 2008 included a $191 million, or 2 percent, favorable impact from process technology license revenue recorded in our Computing Solutions segment and a $227 million, or 4 percent, negative impact from an incremental write-down of inventory. Without the effect of the above events in 2009 and 2008, which we believe gives a more comparable view, gross margin would have been 39 percent in 2009 compared to 42 percent in 2008. Gross margin in the first half of 2009 was adversely impacted by depressed average selling price and the under-utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for our microprocessor products. However, the adverse impact of these factors on 2009 gross margin was partially mitigated by developments during the second half of 2009, including improvements in utilization of GF’s manufacturing facilities and improvements in our unit costs primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of microprocessors that were manufactured using 45 nm process technology. Our operating income for 2009 was $664 million compared to an operating loss of $2.0 billion in 2008. In 2008, the operating loss included a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, $191 million of process technology license revenue and $1.1 billion in impairment charges and charges related to the write-down of assets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income included $1,242 million of income from the settlement of our litigation with Intel. Without the impact of these events, which we believe gives a more comparable view, our operating income would have improved $672 million due principally to a $437 million decrease in our research and development and marketing general and administrative expenses primarily due to the effect of our cost reduction initiatives. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2009 were $2.7 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 27, 2008. Of the $2.7 billion cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $904 million constituted GF cash and cash equivalents. This increase was primarily due to proceeds received upon the consummation of the GF manufacturing joint venture transaction in the first quarter of 2009, proceeds of $1.25 billion from the settlement of our litigation with Intel and $440 million from the issuance of our 8.125% Notes, partially offset by approximately $1.8 billion in payments for the redemption and repurchase of our outstanding debt. In 2009, we also made significant progress in improving our balance sheet by significantly reducing our debt. Without taking into account GF’s indebtedness, during 2009 we reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion. We enter 2010 with a new business model, compelling products and stronger customer demand in an improved economic environment. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we will no longer consolidate the operations of GF. As a result, we expect that in the future, our consolidated cost of sales will be higher and operating expenses will be lower. We also expect that interest expense will be significantly lower because we no longer consolidate GF’s indebtedness.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2009-02-24.@The credit market crisis and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the global economy resulted in a number of challenges for AMD in 2008. In particular, due to the credit markets and the reduced leverage in the economy, both business and consumer spending decreased, including with respect to end-user products that incorporate our products. In particular, during the fourth quarter of 2008, which is typically our strongest quarter during the fiscal year, end user demand for PCs and servers decreased significantly. In turn, our customers sharply reduced orders for our products in order to balance their inventory levels to address end-customer demand. We believe this inventory correction trend will continue across the supply chain into at least the first half of 2009, particularly in connection with notebook PCs. AMD net revenue for 2008 was $5.8 billion, a decrease of 1 percent compared to 2007 net revenue of $5.86 billion. Net revenue in 2008 included $191 million of process technology license revenue related to the sale of 200 millimeter equipment. Excluding this process technology license revenue, 2008 net revenue would have declined 4 percent compared to 2007 due to lower average selling prices and unit volumes for our Computing Solutions segment. Although 2008 net revenue was approximately flat compared to 2007, net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 35 percent compared to the third quarter of 2008 and 33 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the $191 million process technology license revenue from the third quarter of 2008, net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 would have decreased 28 percent from the third quarter of 2008. The decline was primarily due to the global economic environment, which significantly affected demand during the fourth quarter of 2008. Although the fourth quarter results for our Graphics segment were not immune to the impact of the global economic recession, with net revenue for our Graphics segment declining by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2008, net revenue for the Graphics segment increased by 17 percent compared to 2007. The increase in Graphics net revenue was primarily due to the successful introduction of ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of GPU products and a 76 percent increase in royalties received in connection with the sale of game console systems. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2008 was 40 percent, a 3 percent increase compared to 37 percent in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008 we experienced a large incremental write-down of inventory due to a weak economic outlook. This $227 million incremental inventory write-down negatively impacted gross margin in 2008 by 4 percentage points. Gross margin in 2008 was favorably impacted by 2 percentage points as a result of the process technology license revenue referenced above. Without the impact of the incremental write-down of inventory and the technology license revenue, 2008 gross margin would have increased 5 percentage points compared to 2007 primarily due to an improvement in fab utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs. Our operating loss for 2008 was $2 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2007. The reduction in the operating loss was primarily due to a $193 million gain on the sale of 200 millimeter equipment, which is included in the caption “Gain on sale of 200 millimeter equipment” in our 2008 consolidated statement of operations, and the $191 million of process technology license revenue referenced above. Without the impact of the above mentioned gain on tool sales and process technology license revenue, our 2008 operating loss would have been flat compared to 2007. In light of the current economic environment, one of our key priorities is to preserve cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 27, 2008 were $1.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion at December 29, 2007. This decline in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to our significant losses. To that end, during 2008 we undertook, and plan to continue to undertake, a number of actions to decrease our expenses. For 2008 our capital expenditures decreased to $621 million compared to $1.7 billion in 2007. Moreover, in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of 2008 we implemented restructuring plans to reduce our expenses. The plans primarily involve the termination of employees, contract or program terminations and facility site consolidations and closures. In January 2009 we announced additional headcount reductions, primarily focused on our back-end manufacturing and sales, marketing, and general and administrative functions, and cost reduction activities including temporary salary reductions for employees in the United States and Canada and suspension of certain employee benefits. We also plan to reduce our manufacturing output in order to control our inventory levels. Moreover, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in January 2009, we divested our Digital Television business unit and certain assets related to our Handheld business unit, respectively. The aggregate cash consideration for these divestures was over $200 million, and the divestitures will allow us to focus on our core strategy of computing and graphics market opportunities. In addition, in October 2008 we entered into a Master Transaction Agreement with ATIC and WCH to form a manufacturing joint venture, The Foundry Company. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we anticipate certain benefits to our business, including, on a consolidated basis, the infusion of approximately $2.2 billion of cash, of which approximately $800 million will be available for current working capital purposes and $1.4 billion will go to The Foundry Company to fund its operations, including capital expenditures and repayment of approximately $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of indebtedness, which we will transfer to The Foundry Company upon consummation of the transactions. The Foundry Company will record $1 billion of the $1.4 billion as debt from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to ATIC and $400 million as equity from the issuance of securities to ATIC. Because we will consolidate the accounts of The Foundry Company after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, our consolidated balance sheet will present the $1.1 billion (as of December 27, 2008) of transferred indebtedness and the $1 billion of debt related to the issuance of the Convertible Notes as debt and the $400 million as non-controlling interest. However, The Foundry Company will have the obligation to repay the transferred indebtedness and the Convertible Notes. Also, future wafer manufacturing capital expenditures will be the responsibility of The Foundry Company, and after the consummation of the transactions, we will have the option but not the obligation to provide future funding to The Foundry Company. ATIC has committed to provide additional equity funding to The Foundry Company of at least $3.6 billion and up to $6.0 billion over the five years after the closing of the transaction. In 2008 we also made progress towards improving our competitive position across both of our businesses. In November 2008 we launched our first 45-nanometer quad-core AMD Opteron processors, and we expect the transition to 45-nanometer process technology to be completed at Fab 36 by mid-2009. In 2008 and early 2009, we also introduced several new platform products such as our “Puma” and “Yukon” platforms for notebooks and our “Dragon” platform for desktop PCs. With respect to graphics products, we released the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series of products in June 2008. Despite the cost cutting efforts referenced above, one of our key priorities for 2009 is to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain the competitiveness of our product roadmap. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2008-02-26.@Fiscal 2007 was a challenging year for AMD. Our net revenue in 2007 of $6.0 billion increased six percent from net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2006. However, revenue increased because we included the operations of our Graphics and Consumer Electronics segments for the entire fiscal year rather than just nine weeks in 2006. Net revenue for our Computing Solutions segment decreased 12 percent due to lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products, which resulted from delays in the introduction and broad availability of our quad-core processors, aggressive pricing by our principal competitor and a higher concentration of sales of processors for desktop and notebook PCs in 2007. Correspondingly, gross margins in 2007 decreased compared to gross margins in 2006 as a result of lower average selling prices for our microprocessor products and increased manufacturing costs during the first half of 2007. Furthermore, gross margins were adversely impacted due to the consolidation of ATI’s operations into ours for the full fiscal year in 2007 compared to nine weeks in 2006. Historically, the ATI business had lower gross margins compared to AMD. Despite the challenges that we encountered during 2007, we made positive strides towards improving our performance. Although average selling prices for our microprocessor products declined in 2007 compared to 2006, they improved in the second half of 2007 compared to the first half of 2007 as our product mix improved with the introduction of our AMD Opteron quad-core processors for servers and AMD Phenom 9000 series of quad-core processors for desktop PCs. We also secured a new OEM customer, Toshiba Corporation. In the Graphics segment, we introduced the ATI Radeon HD 2000 and 3800 series of products. We also introduced the ATI Mobility Radeon HD series of products for notebook PCs during the second half of 2007 and were able to secure a number of OEM design wins. These new product introductions favorably impacted average selling prices. In the second half of 2007, we also improved gross margins compared to the first half of 2007 due to improved inventory management, manufacturing efficiencies and a richer product mix driven by the launch of new products. We also focused on improving the delivery of products across a diverse set of customers and geographies on a timely basis and, as a result, we witnessed recovery of sales to the distribution channel. In 2007, we also undertook measures to improve our financial position. During the second quarter of 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Notes and in the third quarter of 2007, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes. We used a portion of the proceeds from the 6.00% Notes and all of the proceeds from the 5.75% Notes to repay in full the amount outstanding under the October 2006 term loan agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold and issued 49 million shares of our common stock to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company in exchange for net proceeds of $608 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 29, 2007 totaled $1.9 billion and our debt and capital lease obligations totaled $5.3 billion. We also made significant strides to implement our manufacturing capacity strategy. We converted Fab 36 to 65-nanometer process technology by mid-2007, as planned. We also expanded manufacturing capacity in Fab 36 and completed the addition of a new bump and test facility. We initiated the conversion of Fab 30 from a 200-millimeter to a 300-millimeter manufacturing facility. Fab 30 produced its final 200-millimeter wafer during the fourth quarter of 2007. During 2007, Chartered Semiconductor continued to manufacture AMD64-based processors for us to support incremental demand. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2007-03-01.@Total net revenue in 2006 amounted to $5.6 billion, an increase of 44 percent from net revenue, excluding the Memory Products segment, of $3.9 billion in 2005. 2006 included approximately $400 million of net revenue attributable to our two new reportable segments—Graphics and Chipsets, and Consumer Electronics. Overall growth, however, was primarily driven by the performance of our Computation Products segment where net revenue of $5.1 billion increased by 35 percent compared to 2005 due to increased unit sales of our desktop, mobile and server processors. We believe that our continued strategy of developing products based on our customers’ needs combined with our open standards approach, which allows customers to choose the combination of technologies that best serve their needs, contributed to accelerating customer and end-user adoption of our products across all geographies. During 2006 we also experienced the following: increasing adoption of our products among enterprises; increasing sales of our server and mobile processor products; establishment of relationships with key OEMs such as Dell Inc., Founder Technology and Tsinghua Tongfang and strengthening relationships with existing OEM customers; and a decrease in our dependence on mature markets such as North America and Europe by focusing on high growth markets, such as China. By the end of 2006, 95 percent of the top 100—and over 65 percent of the top 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 were using AMD64 technology, and existing customers continued to expand the number of AMD-based solutions targeting the commercial market. Also, compared to 2005, sales of our mobile and server processor products grew faster than sales of our desktop products. We believe our progress in the marketplace in 2006 will allow us to continue to develop products based on platform solutions. Platforms consist of a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better product than if the technologies were used separately. With our acquisition of ATI in October 2006, which is described in more detail below, we intend to develop and offer integrated CPU and GPU platforms to our customers. However, we also intend to continue to develop and provide discrete microprocessor and graphics processor products and to maintain open interface and software standards in order to allow our customers to choose the combination of technologies that best serve their needs. We also continued to execute our microprocessor manufacturing plans during 2006. During the first quarter, we began commercial shipments of processors manufactured on 300-millimeter wafers at Fab 36. During June 2006, we began shipments of processors manufactured at Chartered Semiconductor, and during the fourth quarter we began commercial shipments of processors manufactured using 65-nanometer technology. We also announced developments in our future manufacturing capacity strategy. In May 2006, we announced plans to significantly expand our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity in Dresden, Germany by converting Fab 30 from manufacturing 200-millimeter wafers to 300-millimeter wafers, expanding the capacity of Fab 36 and adding a new facility to support bump and test activities. We also announced an agreement with the New York State Urban Development Corporation d/b/a Empire State Development Corporation pursuant to which we would receive financial incentives from the State of New York to build a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility on the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Saratoga County, New York if we decide to build the facility. We believe that our investment in expanding the manufacturing capacity of our Dresden operations and the option to build a new manufacturing facility in New York will provide us with maximum flexibility to intelligently scale production to meet market demand. We also faced challenges in 2006, particularly in the second half of the year, due to competitive market conditions. Despite a richer product mix in 2006 compared to 2005, average selling prices remained relatively flat. Higher average selling prices in the first half of 2006 were offset by lower average selling prices in the second half of 2006. Average selling prices decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the third quarter of 2006 particularly for our server processor products, which had a negative impact on fourth quarter gross margin. Similarly, gross margins in 2006 decreased compared to gross margins, excluding the Memory Products segment, in 2005. Higher gross margins in the first half of 2006 were more than offset by lower gross margins in the second half of 2006 due to declining average selling prices, higher manufacturing costs and the consolidation of the operations of ATI, which historically has had lower gross margins than AMD’s business. We believe that 2007 will continue to be extremely competitive, particularly with respect to product pricing. Another challenge in the second half of 2006 related to the ability of our supply chain to keep up with the significant ramp in microprocessor units sold across a diverse set of customers and geographies and to deliver products on a timely basis. One of our key goals in 2007 is to improve the efficiency and scalability of our supply chain. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2006-02-27.@We design, manufacture and market microprocessors for the computing, communications and consumer electronics markets. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, or IPO, of Spansion Inc., our formerly consolidated majority owned subsidiary, on December 21, 2005, which is described in more detail below, we also manufactured and sold Flash memory devices through, Spansion (formerly Spansion LLC). Total net sales for 2005 of $5.8 billion increased 17 percent compared with net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion. This growth was driven by the performance of our Computation Products segment where net sales of $3.8 billion increased by 50 percent compared to 2004, due to increased unit sales and average selling prices. We believe that our strategy of developing new generations of products based on our customers’ needs contributed to accelerating customer and end-user adoption of our microprocessors across all geographies. In particular, our introduction of AMD Turion 64 processors for notebook PCs in March 2005, AMD Opteron dual-core processors for servers and workstations in April 2005, and AMD Athlon 64 dual-core processors for desktop PCs in May 2005 helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products. Moreover, we believe that our sales growth in each of our product lines outpaced the industry, resulting in increased market share for us. Sales of products for the server market was the fastest growing part of our business in 2005, followed by sales of products for notebook PCs and sales of products for desktop PCs. Increasing demand from enterprises for our products allowed us to add a number of new customers. As a result, 90 percent of the top 100, and more than 45 percent of the top 500 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies or their subsidiaries use AMD64 technology. On December 21, 2005, Spansion Inc. completed its IPO of 47,264,000 shares of its Class A common stock. Prior to the IPO, Spansion was our majority owned subsidiary and its financial position, results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours. However, due to Spansion’s IPO, our ownership interest in Spansion was diluted from 60 percent to 37.9 percent. As a result, we no longer exercise control over Spansion and we no longer consolidate Spansion’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows with ours. We began applying the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in Spansion and our share of Spansion’s net income from December 21, 2005 based on our remaining equity interest, which is currently 37.9 percent. The overall growth of our annual net sales was partially offset by the results of our Memory Products segment. In 2005, net sales of our Memory Products segment of approximately $1.9 billion decreased 18 percent compared to net sales of approximately $2.3 billion in 2004. In 2005, we consolidated Spansion’s results of operations in our Memory Products segment only through December 20, 2005 because of Spansion’s IPO. Therefore, approximately $104 million of Spansion’s net sales from December 21, 2005 through December 25, 2005 were excluded from our Memory Products net sales in 2005. Other factors that contributed to the decline in Memory Products net sales included aggressive pricing by competitors due in most cases to oversupply of products in the NOR Flash memory market and a delay in Spansion’s qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category, which contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the first half of 2005. During 2005, we reduced our debt and capital lease obligations by $489 million, which includes the deconsolidation of $370 million of Spansion’s indebtedness to third parties as a result of Spansion’s IPO. Moreover, as of December 25, 2005, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion, which includes cash proceeds of approximately $260 million from Spansion’s repayment of amounts outstanding under loans due to us, compared to $1.2 billion as of December 26, 2004. We also substantially completed the construction and initial facilitization of Fab 36, our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany. We intend to make production shipments of wafers manufactured using 90-nanometer technology in Fab 36 in the first quarter of 2006 and to begin manufacturing using 65-nanometer technology by the end of 2006. Our goal is to be substantially converted to 65-nanometer technology in Fab 36 by mid-2007. The additional capacity gained through the use of larger 300-millimeter wafers plays an important role in our growth plans for the next several years. We plan to add production output on a steady year-to-year basis, while also keeping fab utilization at consistently high levels. For 2006, we anticipate further growth in both annual net sales and market share. We believe critical success factors include our ability to: continue to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly by business enterprises, including small and medium businesses, as well as large enterprises, academic institutions and government institutions; strengthen our relationships with key customers and suppliers and establish relationships with new customers and suppliers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; ramp the production at Fab 36 and at a third-party foundry on a timely basis in response to market requirements; develop and introduce new products on a timely basis and achieve efficient and timely volume production of these products; extend our portfolio of x86 technology from the traditional PC and server markets into embedded applications in such markets as storage subsystems, networking and telephony equipment, handheld computing devices, computation and office equipment products, and consumer electronics; design and deliver products that meet the demands of consumers as digital content becomes increasingly used with a variety of connected digital devices; and continue to expand our participation in high-growth global markets. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2005-03-01.@We design, manufacture and market industry-standard digital ICs that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations, servers, communications equipment such as mobile phones and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products consist primarily of microprocessors and Flash memory devices. We also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets. In 2004, we continued to focus on customer-centric innovation by developing microprocessor and Flash memory products that assist our customers in adding functionality and enhancing the performance of their products. We continued to design and develop microprocessor products based on AMD64 technology, which allow our customers to protect their existing investments by continuing to use their 32-bit software applications while transitioning to a 64-bit platform. As of December 26, 2004, sales of AMD64-based processors represented approximately one-half of our net sales for the Computation Products segment. In Flash memory, we continued to manufacture products based on our MirrorBit technology, which we believe will enable our customers to cost effectively include next-generation applications, such as high-resolution cameras and streaming video, on their mobile phone. We also introduced floating gate memory products manufactured on 110-nanometer technology and substantially completed the integration of our and Fujitsu’s Flash memory operations in Spansion. We also continued to devote resources to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies. During 2004, we successfully transitioned to smaller manufacturing geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products. As of December 26, 2004, we were manufacturing our microprocessor products using primarily 90-nanometer technology and we were manufacturing our highest density and performance Flash memory products on 110-nanometer floating gate and MirrorBit technology. In 2004, despite a net loss in the fourth quarter, we returned to a full year of profitability. Total net sales for 2004 of $5.0 billion increased 42 percent compared with net sales of $3.5 billion for 2003. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the effects of consolidating Spansion’s results of operations, which include sales by Spansion to Fujitsu, for the twelve months in 2004 as compared to six months in 2003. Our transition to smaller manufacturing process geometries for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products contributed to lower manufacturing costs per unit and higher overall gross margins, which, along with increased net sales, contributed to a net income of $91 million in 2004 compared to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. We also substantially completed the construction of Fab 36, our 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany and we are currently in the process of installing equipment. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006, will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our microprocessors. However, in 2004, the cyclical Flash memory market posed unique challenges for us. In the second half of 2004, Memory Products net sales decreased by $259 million, compared to the first half of 2004. Factors that contributed to this decline included aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for Flash memory products. In addition, decreased demand from the wireless handset market in Asia, in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset OEMs in China, contributed to a decline in Memory Products net sales during the third quarter of 2004. The down-turn in the overall Flash memory market, lower than expected sales in Japan and a delay in our qualification of a Flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower Memory Products net sales during the fourth quarter of 2004. For 2005, we believe critical success factors include: continuing to increase market acceptance of our AMD64 technology, particularly in the enterprise segment; taking products based on our second-generation MirrorBit technology to market and effectively ramping such products to mass production on a timely basis; strengthening our relationships with key customers and establishing relationships with new customers that are industry leaders in their markets; successfully developing and continuing to transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies for both our microprocessor and Flash memory products; developing and introducing new microprocessor products for the mobile, server and workstation markets, including dual-core processors, on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; developing and introducing new Flash memory products on a timely basis; controlling costs; increasing the adoption of MirrorBit technology; and expanding our participation in high-growth global markets, including China, Latin America, India and Eastern Europe. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
.@0000002488.@AMD.@2004-03-09.@We design, manufacture and market industry-standard digital integrated circuits that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile PCs, workstations and servers, communications equipment, and automotive and consumer electronics. Our products include microprocessors, Flash memory devices, and Personal Connectivity Solutions products. The semiconductor industry has recently shown signs of recovery from the downturn experienced during 2001 and 2002, which contributed to an improvement in our operating results during 2003 compared to 2002. Total net sales for 2003 of $3,519 million increased 30 percent compared with net sales of $2,697 million for 2002. This increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and Flash memory products across all geographies as well as the consolidation of FASL LLC’s results of operations, which include sales by FASL LLC to Fujitsu. In addition, the restructuring and cost-cutting measures that we initiated in 2002 contributed to significant cost savings in 2003. These cost savings, combined with the increase in revenues, contributed to a 79 percent decrease in net loss from a net loss of $1,303 million in 2002 to a net loss of $274 million in 2003. During 2003, we reached an agreement with Fujitsu to form FASL LLC. The formation of FASL LLC has allowed us to combine our and Fujitsu’s product manufacturing and technology development efforts to respond more quickly to the demands of our Flash memory product customers. As a result of the transaction, we began consolidating FASL LLC’s results of operations on June 30, 2003. However, as FASL LLC did not exist prior to June 30, 2003, the results of operations for prior periods did not include the consolidation of FASL LLC’s operations. Accordingly, the segment operating information for our Memory Products segment for the year ended December 28, 2003, is not fully comparable to the segment information for all prior periods presented. In addition, we introduced our 64-bit microprocessor products during 2003 with the launch of our AMD Opteron processor for servers and workstations in April and our AMD Athlon 64 processor for desktop and mobile PCs in September. In November 2003, we began construction of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Dresden, Germany, which we expect to be in volume production in 2006. We believe the new capacity provided by this facility will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our 64-bit microprocessors. In addition to providing increased capacity, we believe that manufacturing our 64-bit processors on 300-millimeter silicon wafers, and employing advanced manufacturing process technologies, will allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs. For 2004, we believe critical success factors include: increasing market acceptance of 64-bit computing; our and FASL LLC’s ability to successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies; our ability to develop and introduce new products for the server and workstation markets on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets; expanding our participation in emerging global markets, including China, Latin America, India, and Eastern Europe; improving our share of the Flash memory market, including enabling the increased adoption of MirrorBit technology; and maximizing the synergies of FASL LLC.

.@0001018724.@AMZN.@2019-02-01.@Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.

The products offered on our consumer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1 per share. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 490 million and 483 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover4 was 8 for 2015 and 9 for 2014 and 2013. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days5 were 77, 73, and 74 for 2015, 2014, and 2013. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.

.@0001018724.@AMZN.@2010-01-29.@Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered on our customer-facing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell the Kindle e-reader. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by other sellers. We also offer services such as Amazon Web Services, co-branded credit cards, fulfillment, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional offers, such as online advertising. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1 per share. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites and efficiently managing our operating costs, offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, which generally require us to hire additional software engineers, computer scientists, and merchandisers. To increase product sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery times, increasing selection, increasing product categories, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. We generally focus on growing gross profit and operating profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages. We also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe they align the interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures, consisting of vested and unvested awards. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 461 million and 446 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and most aspects of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure, build, enhance, and add features to our websites and our Kindle e-reader, and build and optimize our fulfillment centers. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally increase depending on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct to content provider and manufacturer sourcing, maximize discounts available to us from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle2. On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 12, 12, and 13 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by other sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 68, 62, and 57 for 2009, 2008, and 2007. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by other sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, software engineers, and employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, and systems support. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content, including seller platforms, web services, digital initiatives, and expansion of new and existing product categories, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiencies and support our infrastructure web services. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. We are investing in Amazon Web Services, which provides technology services that give developers access to technology infrastructure that they can use to enable virtually any type of business, and in our Kindle e-reader. A continuing challenge is to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales, gross profit, and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant.

We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since it is affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of third-party sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower-cost broadband service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results, including trends. For example, our total revenue, profit, and operating and free cash flow have recently benefited significantly from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our internationally-focused websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to also evaluate our growth rates before the effect of currency changes. For example, while our revenues increased 31% during 2004 in comparison with the prior year, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 26%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local-currency growth rates. We may have significant variation in our future reported results. We believe that our reported net income for 2004 should not be viewed, on its own, as a material positive event, and the year-over-year increase in net income of $553 million is not necessarily predictive of our future results for a variety of reasons. For example, in 2004 we had a primarily non-cash net benefit from income taxes of $233 million resulting primarily from changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to continuing operations. Additionally, the remeasurement of our 6.875% Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities (“PEACS”) and intercompany balances resulted in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate the effect on our operating trends of these items since future income taxes and changes in currency exchange rates may create significant variability in our future operating results. For additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”
.@0001018724.@AMZN.@2004-02-25.@Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers of our global websites. The products offered on our websites include products we have purchased from distributors and manufacturers and products sold by third parties on our websites. Generally, we recognize revenue as the seller of record from items we offer from our inventory and recognize our net share of revenue of items offered by third parties. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow1. We also seek to minimize shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings and aligning employee interests with shareholders. Free cash flow is driven primarily by increasing consolidated segment operating profit and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures. Increases in consolidated segment operating profit result from increases in sales through our websites and a focus on keeping costs low. To increase sales, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, increasing selection, expanding product information, improving ease of use, and earning customer trust. Our price reductions take several forms: we reduce the sales prices of products we sell, we recruit third-party sellers to compete with us on product detail pages, and we reduce or eliminate the cost of shipping to the consumer. We moved to restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation in late 2002. Restricted stock units result in charges to our income statement; however, we believe they better align the interests of our shareholders and employees. Total shares outstanding plus employee stock awards are essentially unchanged at the end of 2003 compared to 2002. We leverage our fixed customer experience costs and work to reduce our variable cost per unit. Our customer experience costs, specifically the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and build and optimize our fulfillment centers, are largely fixed costs. The customer experience costs that remain variable as a percentage of sales include product costs, credit-card processing fees, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, and certain aspects of our marketing costs. We focus on maintaining a lean culture by reducing defects in our processes, and obtaining volume discounts from suppliers to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers. Because we are able to turn our inventory quickly, we have a negative operating cycle that is a source of cash flow2. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover3 was 18, 19, and 16 for 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability, our future investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers. Accounts payable days4 were 50, 52, and 49 at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. We expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of suppliers, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of negotiating better pricing from our suppliers in exchange for shorter payment terms. Our spending in technology and content will increase as we add computer scientists and software engineers to continue to improve our process efficiency and enhance the customer experience on our websites. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the improved consumer experience of the Internet outside of the workplace through lower cost broad-band service to the home, and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase the ubiquity of computers in people’s lives. Our challenge will be to continue to build and deploy innovative and efficient software that will best take advantage of continued advances in technology. Finally, we want to emphasize that we do not believe that our reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 should be viewed as a material positive event or should be considered predictive of future results. As we discuss in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and Accounting Policies—Foreign Currencies,” had it not been for our decision to settle intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies, we would have reported a small net loss for 2003. Also, as our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, our total revenue, profit, and free cash flow has significantly benefited each of the past two years from weakness in the U.S. Dollar in comparison to the currencies of our faster-growing international websites. While we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our fast growing international businesses benefits our shareholders, it is important to evaluate our growth rates after the effect of currency changes. For example, although we grew 34% during 2003, holding currency exchange constant with the prior year our growth would have been 28%. In the future, this trend may reverse, and our consolidated U.S. Dollar revenue growth rates would be less than our local-currency growth rates.

.@0001091667.@CHTR.@2019-01-31.@We are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 28.1 million residential and small and medium business customers at December 31, 2018. We also recently launched our Spectrum mobile service to residential customers. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to large enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels. See “Part I. Item 1. Business — Products and Services” for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services. Since the close of the Transactions in 2016, we have been focused on integrating the practices and systems of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, centralizing our product, marketing, sales and service operations, insourcing the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House workforces in our call centers and field operations, and rolling out SPP to Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House service areas. In 2018, we completed the conversion of the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog service areas to an all-digital platform enabling us to deliver more HD channels and higher Internet speeds. As of December 31, 2018, nearly all of our footprint was all-digital. Additionally, we have doubled minimum Internet speeds to 200 Mbps in a number of service areas at no additional cost to new and existing Internet customers. In 2018, leveraging DOCSIS 3.1 technology, we also expanded the availability of our Spectrum Internet Gig service to nearly all of our footprint. With our integration nearly complete, we are focused on operating as one company, with a unified product, marketing and service infrastructure, which will allow us to accelerate growth and innovate faster. With significantly less customer-facing change expected in 2019, we are focused on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions. We expect our growing levels of productivity will result in lower customer churn, longer customer lifetimes and improved productivity with fewer customer calls and truck rolls. With over 75% of our residential customer base currently in SPP packages, we expect additional benefits from higher SPP penetration and as current SPP customers roll off introductory pricing combined with modest price increases. Further, we expect to continue to drive customer relationship growth through sales of video, Internet, and wireline and mobile voice packaged services. Additionally, with the completion of our all-digital conversion, roll-out of DOCSIS 3.1 technology across our footprint, and the integration of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House mostly complete, we expect a meaningful reduction in capital expenditures in dollars and as a percent of revenue in 2019. At the end of the second quarter of 2018, we launched our mobile product, Spectrum Mobile, under our MVNO reseller agreement with Verizon. Our Spectrum Mobile service is offered to our residential customers subscribing to our Internet service and runs on Verizon's mobile network combined with our existing network of in-home and outdoor WiFi hotspots. We began mass market advertising of Spectrum Mobile in September 2018. We also continue to explore ways to manage our own network and drive even more mobile traffic to our network through our continued deployment of in-home and outdoor WiFi hotspots. In 2018, we invested in our mobile operating partnership with Comcast Corporation, with a portion representing our equity investment in the partnership and a portion representing a prepayment of software development and related services for the mobile back office platform. As the partnership delivers services, we will reflect such services as capital or operating expense depending on the nature of services delivered. We believe Spectrum-branded mobile services will drive higher sales of our core products, create longer customer lives and increase profitability and cash flow over time. As a result of growth costs associated with our new mobile product line, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our mobile product line increased revenues by $106 million, and reduced Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by approximately $240 million and $594 million, respectively. As we continue to launch our mobile service and scale the business, we expect continued negative impacts to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when we provide the handset or tablet to customers pursuant to equipment installment plans. In 2019, we intend to expand our Spectrum Mobile bring-your-own-device ("BYOD") program across our key sales channels to include a broader set of devices. We believe our BYOD program will lower the cost for consumers of switching mobile carriers, and will reduce the short-term working capital impact of selling new mobile devices on installment plans. The Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other pension benefits, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to growth in our residential Internet and commercial business customers as well as an increase in advertising sales revenue primarily due to an increase in political revenue. Adjusted EBITDA growth was additionally affected by increases in operating costs and expenses primarily programming and, in 2018, mobile. Income from operations was also affected by changes in depreciation and amortization as well as decreases in merger and restructuring costs. Approximately 91%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 9%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), VOD and pay-per-view programming, installation, process

In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to large enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services in the residential marketplace. See “Part I. Item 1. Business — Products and Services” for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services. In the first half of 2017, we completed the roll-out of SPP to Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets simplifying our offers and improving our packaging of products, allowing us to deliver more value to new and existing customers. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 60% of our residential customers are in an SPP package. In the second half of 2017, we began converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform enabling us to deliver more HD channels and higher Internet speeds. The bulk of this all-digital initiative will take place in 2018. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas. In 2017, we began migrating Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers to Legacy Charter's model of using virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We are focused on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We intend to continue to insource the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House workforces in our call centers and in our field operations which we expect to lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes. Our integration activities will continue in 2018 with the expectation that by 2019 we will have substantially integrated the practices and systems of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House. In 2018, we will also launch our mobile product. As a result of growth costs for a new product line and implementing our operating strategy across Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.

See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses. Revenue growth during 2017 was offset by lower advertising sales revenue due to a decrease in political and local advertising and an early contract termination benefit at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House in 2016. In addition to the items noted above, Adjusted EBITDA growth on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in programming costs and, in 2017, offset by decreases in costs to service customers and other operating costs and expenses. Income from operations on a pro forma basis was additionally affected by increases in depreciation and amortization as well as changes in merger and restructuring costs. Approximately 91%, 90% and 91% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 9%, 10% and 9% of revenue for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), VOD and pay-per-view programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, revenue from regional sports and news channels and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services. We incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions). Amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies’ systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  Interest expense associated with the Transactions represents interest incurred on the CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III and CCOH Safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the Transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the Transactions.

Since 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes. As a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations.

We will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the Transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future.

Our most significant competitors are direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functions similar to our Internet, video and voice services, including in some cases wireless services, and they also offer these services in bundles similar to ours. Customers have been more willing to consider our competitors' products, partially because of continued marketing highlighting perceived differences between competitive video products, especially when those competitors are often offering significant incentives to switch providers. Some consumers have chosen to receive video over the Internet rather than through pay television services including from us. See “Part I. Item 1. Business — Competition.”  In the recent past, we have grown revenues by offsetting basic video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental services such as Internet, video on demand, DVR and HD television. We expect to continue to grow revenues by increasing the number of products in our current customer homes, obtaining new customers with our value offering and reducing churn. In addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales of services to our commercial customers. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates. Our business plans include goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our goals, we actively invest in our network and operations, and improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer. We have enhanced our video product by moving to an all-digital platform, offering more HD channels and increasing digital and HD-DVR penetration. We simplified our offers and pricing, and package our products with the objective of bringing more value to new and existing customers than our competitors. As part of our effort to create more value for customers, we focus on driving penetration of our triple play offering, which includes more than 200 HD channels in most of our markets, video on demand, Internet service, and fully-featured voice service. In addition, we have fully insourced our direct sales workforce and are increasingly insourcing our field operations and call center workforces and modifying the way our sales workforce is compensated, which we believe positions us for better customer service and growth. We believe that our enhanced product set combined with improved customer service has lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes, allowing us to grow our customer base and revenue more quickly and economically. Total revenue growth was 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014, and 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, due to growth in our video, Internet and commercial businesses. Total revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of Bresnan as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014 and 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013 as a result of an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs, transition costs and other operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA growth on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of Bresnan as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013.

Our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. Operating costs primarily include programming costs, connectivity, franchise and other regulatory costs, the costs to service our customers such as field, network and customer operations costs, marketing costs and transition costs related to the TWC Transaction, Bright House Transaction and Comcast Transactions. Transition costs represent incremental costs incurred to increase the scale of our business as a result of the TWC Transaction, Bright House Transaction and Comcast Transactions. In July 2013, Charter and Charter Operating acquired Bresnan from a wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, for $1.625 billion in cash, as well as a working capital adjustment and a reduction for certain funded indebtedness of Bresnan (the "Bresnan Acquisition"). Bresnan managed cable operating systems in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Utah that passed approximately 670,000 homes and served approximately 375,000 residential and commercial customer relationships at the time they were acquired. We have a history of net losses.  Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur because of our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and non-cash taxes resulting from increases in our deferred tax liabilities.

We expect to continue to grow revenues by increasing the number of products in our current customer homes and obtaining new customers with an improved value offering. In addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales of services to our commercial customers.  However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates. Our business plans include goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our goals, we have actively invested in our network and operations, and have improved the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer. We have enhanced our video product by moving to an all-digital platform, offering more HD channels and increasing digital and HD-DVR penetration. We simplified our offers and pricing and improved our packaging of products to bring more value to new and existing customers. As part of our effort to create more value for customers, we have focused on driving penetration of our triple play offering, which includes more than 200 HD channels in most of our markets, video on demand, Internet service, and fully-featured voice service. In addition, we have implemented a number of changes to our organizational structure, selling methods and operating tactics. We have fully insourced our direct sales workforce and are increasingly insourcing our field operations and call center workforces and modifying the way our sales workforce is compensated, which we believe positions us for better customer service and growth. We expect that our enhanced product set combined with improved customer service will lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes, allowing us to grow our customer base and revenue more quickly and economically. We expect our capital expenditures to remain elevated as we strive to increase digital and HD-DVR penetration and place higher levels of customer premise equipment per transaction. In July 2013, Charter and Charter Operating acquired Bresnan from a wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, for $1.625 billion in cash, as well as a working capital adjustment and a reduction for certain funded indebtedness of Bresnan (the "Bresnan Acquisition"). Bresnan managed cable operating systems in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Utah that passed approximately 670,000 homes and served approximately 375,000 residential and commercial customer relationships at the time they were acquired. Total revenue growth was 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, and 9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, due to the Bresnan Acquisition and growth in our video, Internet and commercial businesses. Total revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the Bresnan Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, and 5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net, and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013 and 6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012 as a result of the Bresnan Acquisition, which contributed $96 million and $90 million, respectively, and an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our income from operations was $971 million, $909 million and $915 million, respectively. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the Bresnan Acquisition and current capital expenditures. In connection with the Transactions, in 2014 we have incurred approximately $14 million in operating costs and expenses and $27 million of capital expenditures related to incremental transition costs required to position Charter to double its service footprint. We also incurred $38 million of incremental expenses related to advisory, legal and accounting fees which are reflected in other operating expenses, as well as approximately $75 million of interest expense associated with term loan G that was entered into in September 2014 and the issuance of the CCOH Safari Notes in November 2014. See "Part I. Item 1. Business — Transactions with Comcast." Approximately 90%, 89% and 87% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 10%, 11% and 13% of revenue for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and video on demand programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services. Our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. Operating costs primarily include programming costs, connectivity, franchise and other regulatory costs, the cost to service our customers such as field, network and customer operations costs and marketing costs. We have a history of net losses.  Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur because of our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and non-cash taxes resulting from increases in our deferred tax liabilities.

Total revenue growth was 9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, and 4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011, due to the Bresnan Acquisition and growth in our video, Internet and commercial businesses. Total revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the Bresnan Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2011 was 5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012, and 4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, adjusted earnings (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $2.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.  See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012 as a result of the Bresnan Acquisition, which contributed $90 million, and an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs, costs to service customers and marketing costs. Costs to service customers primarily increased from higher labor to deliver improved products and service levels and greater reconnect expense. Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 as a result of an increase in Internet, commercial and advertising revenues offset by higher programming costs, expenses associated with driving higher growth and investments in the customer experience. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our income from operations was $925 million, $916 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the Bresnan Acquisition. We believe that continued competition and the prolonged recovery of economic conditions in the United States, including mixed recovery in the housing market and relatively high unemployment levels, have adversely affected consumer demand for our services, particularly video. Historically, our primary video competitors have often offered more HD channels and have typically only offered digital services which have a better picture quality compared to our legacy analog product.  In response, Charter has promoted its digital product and initiated a transition from analog to digital transmission of all channels we distribute, which will result in substantially more HD channels and higher Internet speeds. In the current economic environment, customers have been more willing to consider our competitors' products, partially because of increased marketing highlighting perceived differences between competitive video products, especially when those competitors are often offering significant incentives to switch providers. We also believe some customers have chosen to receive video over the Internet rather than through our OnDemand and premium video services, thereby reducing our video revenues. We believe competition from wireless service operators and economic factors have contributed to an increase in the number of homes that replace their traditional telephone service with wireless service thereby impacting the growth of our telephone business. If the economic and competitive conditions discussed above do not improve, we believe our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill. Approximately 89% and 87% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers and certain residential customers acquired before July 1, 2012. The remaining 11% and 13% of revenue for fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and OnDemand programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.

Video revenues remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding prior period and declined 2% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the corresponding prior period. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, adjusted earnings (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $2.7 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.  See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 as a result of an increase in Internet, commercial and advertising revenues offset by higher programming costs, expenses associated with driving higher growth and investments in the customer experience. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our income from operations was $916 million, and for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our income from operations was $1.0 billion. The decrease in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the corresponding prior periods is primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization. Our business plans include goals for increasing the number of customers and revenue.  To reach our goals, we have been working to further improve the quality of the video product we offer by increasing digital and HD-DVR penetration and no longer actively marketing analog service.  In 2012, we accelerated these improvements.  Our goal was 100 HD channels across substantially all of our footprint by the end of the year and we reached that goal in July 2012.  We have simplified our offers and pricing and improved our packaging of products to bring more value to our customers, with particular focus on offers aimed at new customers to increase the penetration of our products in our markets including through our emphasis on the triple play.  In addition, we are implementing a number of changes to our organizational structure, selling methods and operating tactics which we believe will position us for better customer service and growth. In the short term, however, we expect that customer connects, revenue and operating expenses may be adversely impacted during this transition. We also expect our capital expenditures to remain elevated as we strive to increase digital and HD-DVR penetration, place higher levels of customer premise equipment per transaction and progressively move to an all-digital platform. We believe that continued competition and the weakened economic conditions in the United States, including weakness in the housing market and relatively high unemployment levels, have adversely affected consumer demand for our services, particularly basic video. Our video competitors often offer more channels, including more HD channels, and typically only offer digital services which have a better picture quality compared to our analog product. In the current economic environment, customers have been more willing to consider our competitors' products, partially because of increased marketing highlighting perceived differences between competitive video products, especially when those competitors are often offering significant incentives to switch providers. We also believe some customers have chosen to receive video over the Internet rather than through our OnDemand and premium video services, thereby reducing our video revenues. We believe competition from wireless and economic factors have contributed to an increase in the number of homes that replace their traditional telephone service with wireless service thereby impacting the growth of our telephone business. If the economic and competitive conditions discussed above do not improve, or our efforts to improve our products and the way we market those products are not ultimately successful in increasing our growth, we believe our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill. Approximately 85% of our revenues for both of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, telephone, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for early termination of a price guarantee product. The remaining 15% of revenue for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and OnDemand programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.

We offer our customers traditional cable video programming (basic and digital video), Internet services, and telephone services, as well as advanced video services such as OnDemandTM (“OnDemand”), HD television and digital video recorder (“DVR”) service. We also sell local advertising on cable networks and provide fiber connectivity to cellular towers. See “Part I. Item 1.

We expect to continue to grow revenues in this manner and in addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales of services to our commercial customers and non-video customers.  However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates. After giving effect to divestitures and acquisitions of cable systems in 2010 and 2011, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a decrease in total customers of approximately 12,400 and 116,500, respectively, and lost approximately 215,500 and 214,800 residential basic video customers, respectively. We believe that continued competition and the weakened economic conditions in the United States, including the housing market and relatively high unemployment levels, have adversely affected consumer demand for our services, particularly basic video. These conditions combined with our disciplined customer acquisition strategy contributed to video revenues declining 2% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the corresponding period in 2010 and remaining flat for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the corresponding period in 2009. Total revenue growth was 2% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the corresponding period in 2010 and 5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the corresponding period in 2009 as we continued to grow our commercial, Internet and telephone businesses. However, we believe competition from wireless and economic factors have contributed to an increase in the number of homes that replace their traditional telephone service with wireless service thereby impacting the growth of our telephone business. Our business plans include goals for increasing the number of customers which contribute to recurring revenue and the opportunity to sell additional services to existing customers. In 2012, we may continue to experience challenges in increasing, or we may continue to lose, customers. If these conditions do not improve, we believe the growth of our business and results of operations will be further adversely affected which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill. Approximately 85% of our revenues for both of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, telephone, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for early termination of a price guarantee product.

Our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment of franchise intangibles and interest expense. Operating costs primarily include programming costs, the cost of our workforce, cable service related expenses, advertising sales costs and franchise fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits, rent expense, billing costs, call center costs, internal network costs, bad debt expense, and property taxes. We control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls on expenditures. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure by improving workforce productivity, increasing the effectiveness of our purchasing activities and maintaining discipline in customer acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, adjusted earnings (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.  See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of continued growth in high margin Internet, commercial and telephone customers, continued disciplined customer acquisition and improving customer service levels.  For each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our income from operations was $1.0 billion, and for the year ended 2009, our loss from operations was $979 million.  Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 compared to the loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to impairment of franchises incurred during 2009 that did not recur in 2011 and 2010. We have a history of net losses.  Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur because of our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties, amortization expenses resulting from the application of fresh start accounting in 2010 and non-cash taxes resulting from increases in our deferred tax liabilities. The Plan resulted in the reduction of the principal amount of our debt by approximately $8 billion, reducing our interest expense by approximately $830 million annually.

SCE is an investor-owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying and delivering electricity to an approximately 50,000 square mile area of southern California. Edison Energy Group is a holding company for Edison Energy which is engaged in the competitive business of providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers. Edison Energy's business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment. References to Edison International refer to the consolidated group of Edison International and its subsidiaries. References to Edison International Parent and Other refer to Edison International Parent and its competitive subsidiaries. Unless otherwise described, all the information contained in this report relates to both filers. Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses core earnings (losses) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company's performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less non-core items. Non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations, income resulting from allocation of losses to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method (related to previous results of SoCore Energy which was sold in the second quarter of 2018) and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other gains and losses related to certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing. Edison International's 2018 earnings decreased $988 million, driven by a decrease in SCE's earnings of $1,322 million, partially offset by a decrease in Edison International Parent and Other losses of $300 million, and $34 million income from discontinued operations. SCE's lower net income consisted of $1,269 million of higher non-core losses and $53 million of lower core earnings. The decrease in core earnings was due to the impact of the July 2017 cost of capital decision on GRC revenue, higher operation and maintenance expenses related to wildfire insurance premiums and vegetation management and higher net financing costs, partially offset by higher income tax benefits. Edison International Parent and Other losses from continuing operations for 2018 consisted of $62 million of higher core losses and $362 million of lower non-core losses. The increase in core losses in 2018 was due to income tax benefits in 2017 related to stock option exercises, net operating loss carrybacks from the filing of the 2016 tax returns in 2017, the 2017 settlement of federal income tax audits for 2007 – 2012 and the impact of Tax Reform on pre-tax losses, partially offset by a California tax audit settlement and the absence of SoCore Energy losses due to its sale in April 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Edison International reached a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board for tax years 1994 – 2006. Edison International and SCE also updated their uncertain tax positions to reflect the settlement. Certain components of the settlement related to ongoing business activity of Edison International and SCE and are reflected in core earnings. Other components of the settlement related to legacy businesses of Edison International with no ongoing operations or tax positions that are no longer indicative of Edison International or SCE's ongoing earnings and are reflected in discontinued operations and non-core earnings, respectively. Overall, the settlement of the 1994 – 2006 California tax audits resulted in total tax benefits of $103 million at Edison International ($15 million core earnings, $54 million non-core earnings and $34 million earnings from discontinued operations) and $70 million at SCE ($4 million core earnings and $66 million non-core earnings). Consolidated non-core items for 2018 and 2017 for Edison International included: Charge of $2.5 billion ($1.8 billion after-tax) in 2018 for SCE's wildfire-related claims, net of expected recoveries from insurance and FERC customers. Loss of $56 million ($46 million after-tax) in 2018 for Edison International Parent and Other primarily related to sale of SoCore Energy in April 2018 and income of $21 million ($13 million after-tax) in 2017 related to losses (net of distributions) allocated to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method. For further information on HLBV, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Income of $12 million ($9 million after-tax) in 2018 and charge of $716 million ($448 million after-tax) in 2017 for SCE related to the Revised San Onofre Settlement Agreement. For further information, see "—Permanent Retirement of San Onofre" below. Income tax expense of $12 million, an income tax benefit of $66 million and an income tax benefit of $34 million in 2018 for Edison International Parent and Other, SCE and discontinued operations, respectively, related to the settlement of the 1994 – 2006 California tax audits discussed above. Charges of $433 million in 2017 for Edison International Parent and Other and $33 million for SCE from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform").

Edison International's 2017 earnings decreased $746 million, driven by a decrease in SCE's earnings of $364 million and a decrease in Edison International Parent and Other earnings of $370 million and lower income from discontinued operations. SCE's lower net income consisted of $481 million of higher non-core losses, mainly the result of the Revised San Onofre Settlement Agreement, and $117 million of higher core earnings. The increase in core earnings was due to an increase in revenue from the escalation mechanism set forth in the 2015 GRC decision and lower operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net financing costs. Edison International Parent and Other losses from continuing operations for 2017 consisted of $55 million of lower core losses and $425 million of higher non-core losses. The decrease in core losses in 2017 was due to higher income tax benefits related to stock option exercises, net operating loss carrybacks from the filing of the 2016 tax returns in 2017, the 2017 settlement of federal income tax audits for 2007 – 2012 and higher Edison Energy Group operating revenue.

Edison International core earnings reflected the operating results of the solar projects, related financings and the priority return to the tax equity investor. The losses allocated to the tax equity investor under HLBV accounting method results in income allocated to subsidiaries of Edison International, neither of which is due to the operating performance of the projects but rather due to the allocation of income tax attributes under the tax equity financing. Accordingly, Edison International has included the non-operating allocation of income as a non-core item. For further information on HLBV, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Income from discontinued operations was $1 million ($12 million after-tax) and $15 million ($35 million after-tax) for 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was primarily related to the resolution of tax issues related to EME. The discontinued operations from 2015 also reflects proceeds from insurance recoveries related to EME. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes" for further information. Tax expense of $382 million in 2015 related to the write-down of regulatory assets previously recorded for recovery of deferred income taxes from 2012 – 2014 incremental tax repair deductions resulting from the 2015 GRC decision.

SCE's 2015 core earnings decreased $157 million for the year primarily from lower CPUC-related revenue which reflects the implementation of the 2015 CPUC General Rate Case decision partially offset by an increase in FERC-related revenue from rate base growth, lower operation and maintenance and earnings on funds used during construction. In addition, income tax benefits were lower in 2015. During 2015, SCE recorded $100 million of income tax benefits from revisions to liabilities for uncertain tax positions for tax years 2010 through 2012. These benefits were partially offset by changes in estimated taxes related to net operating loss carrybacks, interest and state income taxes.

An income tax benefit of $7 million in the first quarter of 2013 from reduction in state income taxes related to the sale of Edison Capital's interest in Unit No. 2 of the Beaver Valley Power plant. The sale of Edison Capital's lease interest was completed in 2012. However, the final determination of state income taxes paid was not completed until the first quarter of 2013 which resulted in a change in the estimate of state income taxes due. Income of $2 million related to losses allocated to tax equity investors under the HLBV accounting method. For further information, see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Edison International reflected in core earnings the operating results of the solar rooftop projects, related financings and the priority return to tax equity investor. The losses allocated to the tax equity investor under HLBV method results in income allocated to subsidiaries of Edison International, neither of which is due to the performance of the projects but rather due to the allocation of income tax attributes under the tax equity financing. Accordingly, Edison International has included the non-operating allocation of income as a non-core item.
.@0000827052.@EIX.@2014-02-25.@Edison International is the parent holding company of SCE. SCE is an investor-owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying and delivering electricity. Edison International is also the parent company of subsidiaries that are engaged in competitive businesses related to the generation or use of electricity. Such competitive business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment. References to Edison International refer to the consolidated group of Edison International and its subsidiaries. References to Edison International Parent and Other refer to Edison International Parent and its nonutility subsidiaries. Unless otherwise described, all of the information contained in this annual report relates to both filers. Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP used in the United States. Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings (losses) are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings. On December 17, 2012, EME and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Edison International considers EME to be an abandoned asset under GAAP, and, as a result, the operations of EME prior to December 17, 2012 are reflected as discontinued operations. SCE's 2013 core earnings decreased $73 million for the year primarily due to lower income tax benefits, ceasing to record a return on rate base for San Onofre after the decision to permanently retire the plant, partially offset by lower incremental inspection and repair costs at San Onofre and lower operating costs. The earnings increase from the rate base growth was offset by the lower authorized 2013 return on common equity. Edison International Parent and Other 2013 core losses decreased $32 million primarily due to higher core earnings from Edison Capital, lower costs and taxes. Consolidated non-core items for 2013 and 2012 for Edison International included: An impairment charge of $575 million ($365 million after tax) in 2013 related to the permanent retirement of San Onofre Units 2 and 3. An income tax benefit of $36 million for 2013 from a revised estimate of the tax impact of the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of EME from Edison International. Edison International continues to consolidate EME for federal and certain combined state tax returns. Changes in the amount of tax attributes in 2013 affected income taxes of discontinued operations. Such benefits may or may not continue in future periods. For further information, see "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes." An after-tax earnings charge of $1.3 billion in 2012 due to the full impairment of the investment in EME as a result of the deconsolidation of EME, recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, a provision for losses from the EME bankruptcy and tax impacts related to the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of EME from Edison International. See "Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Discontinued Operations" for further information. An after-tax earnings benefit of $231 million recorded in 2012 resulting from the regulatory treatment of 2009 – 2011 income tax repair deductions for income tax purposes as adopted in the 2012 GRC decision. See "Results of Operations—SCE—Income Taxes" for further discussion. An after-tax earnings charge of $37 million recorded in 2012 resulting from Edison International's update to its estimated long-term California apportionment rate applicable to deferred income taxes as a result of changes related to EME. An after-tax earnings benefit of $31 million ($65 million pre-tax gain) recorded in 2012 attributable to Edison Capital's sale of its lease interest in Unit No. 2 of the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Plant to a third party for $108 million. The final determination of state income taxes was not completed until the first quarter of 2013 which resulted in $7 million of lower state income tax expense than previously estimated.

On December 17, 2012, EME and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. Edison International considers EME to be an abandoned asset under generally accepted accounting principles, and, as a result, the operations of EME prior to December 17, 2012 and for all prior years, are reflected as discontinued operations. SCE's 2012 core earnings increased $253 million for the year primarily due to rate base growth and lower income taxes which reflect the implementation of the 2012 CPUC General Rate Case ("GRC") decision. SCE also incurred incremental inspection and repair costs related to the outages at San Onofre of $66 million, net of SCE's share of amounts received from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Inc. ("MHI"), and $112 million in severance costs. Severance costs are related to employee reductions at San Onofre, as planned in the 2012 GRC, and approved employee reductions for 2013 as SCE works to optimize its cost structure and to minimize impacts on customer rates. These costs were partially offset by other operations and maintenance cost reductions. Edison International Parent and Other 2012 core losses increased $51 million as a result of income tax benefits in 2011. Core losses in 2012 also reflect higher income taxes, a write-down of an investment and higher operating expenses and interest costs. Consolidated non-core items for 2012 and 2011 for Edison International included: An after-tax earnings charge of $1.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the full impairment of the investment in EME as a result of the deconsolidation of EME, recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, a provision for losses from the EME bankruptcy and tax impacts related to the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of EME from Edison International.

SCE's 2011 core earnings increased $101 million primarily due to rate base growth. EMG's 2011 core earnings declined $217 million due to lower realized energy and capacity prices along with lower. generation from merchant coal plants, higher plant maintenance costs from outages, higher interest expense related to renewable projects, and lower trading income. Edison International Parent and Other 2011 core results changed primarily due to higher tax benefits in 2011 compared to 2010. Consolidated non-core items for Edison International included: An after-tax earnings charge of $1.09 billion ($1.76 billion pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting primarily from the impairment the Homer City, Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan power plants, wind related charges, write-down of a net investment in aircraft leases with American Airlines, and the impact on Edison International consolidated deferred income taxes resulting from an increase in the state apportionment rates due to such impairment charges as discussed further below and in "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Asset Impairments, Lease Terminations and Other." An after tax earnings benefit of $175 million recorded in 2010 relating to the California impact of the federal Global Settlement resulting from acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of tax positions finalized with the IRS in 2009 and receipt of the final interest determination from the Franchise Tax Board. For further discussion of the Global Settlement, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes." An after-tax earnings charge of $39 million recorded in 2010 to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by federal health care legislation enacted in 2010.

.@0000827052.@EIX.@2011-02-28.@Edison International is a holding company whose operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Its principal wholly owned subsidiaries are SCE, a rate-regulated electric utility that supplies electric energy to an approximately 50,000 square-mile area of southern California; and EMG, a wholly owned competitive power generation company that operates in 12 states. Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies.

SCE's 2010 core earnings increased $110 million primarily due to higher operating income and capitalized financing costs (AFUDC), both driven by higher rate base growth, and lower income tax expense. The lower tax expense in 2010 includes a change in the method of tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to SCE's infrastructure replacement program. EMG's 2010 core earnings decreased $30 million from 2009 primarily from higher plant maintenance costs in 2010 due to scheduled outages in EMG's merchant power plants, unrealized losses in 2010 compared to gains in 2009, higher income tax expense partially offset by higher energy trading revenues. Edison International Parent and Other 2010 core losses increased from 2009 primarily due to higher interest and general and administrative costs. Consolidated non-core items for Edison International included: An after tax earnings benefit of $175 million recorded in 2010 relating to the California impact of the federal Global Settlement resulting from acceptance by the California Franchise Tax Board of tax positions finalized with the IRS in 2009 and a revision to interest recorded on the federal Global Settlement. In 2009, Edison International recorded an after-tax earnings charge of $254 million related to the Global Settlement with the IRS and termination of EMG's cross-border leases ($920 million pre-tax loss). For further discussion of the Global Settlement, see "Item 8. Edison International Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes." An after tax earnings charge of $39 million recorded in 2010 to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by the recently enacted federal health care legislation. The new health care law eliminated the federal tax deduction for retiree health care costs to the extent those costs are eligible for federal Medicare Part D subsidies. An after-tax earnings charge of $24 million ($40 million pre-tax) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 resulting from the write-off of capitalized engineering and other costs for air emissions control technology that is not currently being pursued for use at the Powerton Station. These activities were previously suspended as Midwest Generation pursued testing and evaluation of the use of a dry sorbent injection system using Trona or similar sorbents which is expected to require lower capital costs. The Illinois EPA recently issued a construction permit to authorize installation of a dry sorbent injection system, which Midwest Generation currently expects to use if this project is undertaken.

.@0000827052.@EIX.@2010-03-01.@Edison International is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiaries are SCE, a rate-regulated electric utility, and EMG, the holding company of Edison International's competitive power generation (EME) and financial services (Edison Capital) segments. As a holding company, Edison International's progress and outlook are the result of developments at its operating subsidiaries. This overview is presented in five sections: Highlights of operating results; SCE capital investment plan to maintain reliability and expand the capability of SCE's distribution and transmission infrastructure, support initiatives in California to increase renewable energy, construct and replace generating assets and deploy advanced metering capability; Environmental developments, including compliance activities at EMG's Midwest Generation and Homer City plants, and legislative, regulatory and legal developments related to greenhouse gases and once-through cooling; Update on EMG's renewable programs; and Information regarding Edison International liquidity. Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: settlement of prior year tax liabilities; exit activities, including lease terminations, asset impairments, sale of certain assets, early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing; and non-recurring regulatory or legal proceedings. SCE's 2009 core earnings increased from 2008 primarily due to higher operating income associated with the CPUC and FERC 2009 general rate case decisions, partially offset by higher income taxes. In addition, core earnings were favorably impacted from lower than planned financings during the year, primarily from cash received for tax-related timing differences and other benefits. During 2009, SCE received general rate case decisions from the CPUC and FERC, as follows: The CPUC issued a decision in SCE's 2009 GRC, authorizing a $4.83 billion revenue requirement for 2009, an increase of $512 million from SCE's 2008 revenue requirement, effective January 1, 2009. The CPUC also authorized a methodology that would result in an approximate revenue requirement of $5.04 billion in 2010 and $5.25 billion in 2011. The FERC approved a settlement to the 2009 rate case effective March 1, 2009. The settlement provides for a transmission revenue requirement of $448 million, an increase of $136 million over the previously authorized amount. EMG 2009 core earnings were significantly lower than 2008 primarily due to the following: Lower wholesale energy prices reduced revenues from EME's merchant coal-fired generation and trading operations. The effects of the economic recession and mild weather during the summer months contributed to declines in electrical demand for the Northern Illinois and PJM West locations during 2009. Electrical load, calculated from data published by PJM, for these locations declined 5% and 3%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the price of natural gas, which often serves as the marginal fuel source in the region, declined significantly. The reduction in natural gas prices together with lower electrical demand resulted in significantly lower wholesale energy prices. The average 24-hour PJM real-time price for energy at the Northern Illinois Hub and the PJM West Hub declined to $28.86/MWh and $38.31/MWh, respectively, during 2009 as compared to $49.01/MWh and $68.56/MWh, respectively, during 2008. Lower electrical load contributed to decreased transmission congestion in the eastern power grid, thereby resulting in $115 million lower trading income in 2009 as compared to 2008. Higher costs were incurred at Midwest Generation to comply with the CAIR annual NOx emission program that began in 2009 and new mercury emission controls. Partially offsetting these higher costs were cost reductions at Midwest Generation and Homer City due in part to the deferral of plant overhaul activities. Lower earnings occurred at Edison Capital primarily due to a decline in lease income following the termination of cross border leases, which occurred as part of the Global Settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. Consolidated changes in non-core items for Edison International include the following: An after-tax loss of $254 million in 2009 resulted from the Global Settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and termination of Edison Capital's cross border leases. The 2009 loss is net of a $19 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of federal interest related to the settlement. The Global Settlement resolved federal tax disputes related to Edison Capital's cross-border, leveraged leases through 2009, and all other outstanding federal tax disputes and affirmative claims of Edison International for tax years 1986 through 2002. An after-tax non-cash benefit of $46 million was recorded in 2009 from the transfer of the Mountainview power plant to utility rate base pursuant to approvals by the CPUC and FERC. An after-tax charge of $49 million in 2008 from a decision by the CPUC disallowing certain amounts and imposing penalties under its performance-based ratemaking program for the period 1997 – 2003.

We use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making solutions and processing services for our clients. We also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. Additionally, we are a leading provider of payroll-related and human resource management business process outsourcing services in the United States of America, or U.S. For consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions. We currently operate in four global regions: North America (U.S. and Canada), Asia Pacific (Australia, New Zealand and India), Europe (the United Kingdom, or U.K., Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). We maintain support operations in the Republic of Ireland, Chile, Costa Rica and India. We also offer Equifax branded credit services in Russia and India through joint ventures, have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company in Brazil. Demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity, small commercial credit and marketing activity. Demand is also enhanced by our initiatives to expand our products, capabilities, and markets served. In the United States, we expect 2019 economic activity, as measured by GDP, to be down from the levels seen in the second half of 2018. We expect modest growth in consumer credit, excluding mortgage, over the course of 2019. U.S. Mortgage market originations are expected to be much weaker in the first half of 2019 and down for the full year of 2019 versus 2018. We anticipate 2019 economic activity, as measured by GDP, in Canada to be slightly below the levels seen in the second half of 2018. In Australia, as measured by GDP, we anticipate 2019 economic activity to be below the levels seen in the second half of 2018 due to overall weakness in consumer credit markets. In the European markets we serve, the U.K., Spain and Portugal, we are expecting 2019 economic activity, as measured by GDP, to be at or slightly below the levels in 2018. In Latin America, our two largest markets are in Argentina and Chile. In Argentina, the market weakened significantly in 2018. We are expecting continued weakness in 2019 but at lower levels than in 2018. In Chile, we are expecting economic activity in 2019 to be down slightly compared to 2018. The 2017 cybersecurity incident is expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, principally in our USIS and Global Consumer Solutions businesses. We have incurred, in 2018, and will continue to incur, in 2019, legal, consulting and other costs related to the analysis and response to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Additionally, in 2018 and beyond, we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and capital expenditures related to our technology transformation, which includes costs for enhanced data security. In 2018 and beyond, we had and will continue to have increases in the ongoing run-rate of technology and security spending. We also expect to continue to incur increased expenses for insurance, finance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. The ultimate amount of these increases is expected to be significant. As a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we are subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations based on the various stages of these proceedings and investigations, that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues. The Company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods and may reduce available resources to invest in technology and innovation.

In Argentina and Chile, our two largest markets in our Latin American Region, we are expecting 2018 economic activity, again as measured by GDP, to increase from the levels in calendar year 2017. The cybersecurity incident announced in the third quarter of 2017 is expected to negatively impact revenue, principally in our U.S. businesses, and to a lesser extent in Canada and the U.K., in 2018. We will also incur, in 2018, legal, consulting and other costs related to the analysis and response to the cybersecurity incident. In 2018, we will incur costs and capital expenditures for providing the free TrustedID credit file monitoring and identity theft protection, and free Lock & AlertTM, to U.S. consumers, as well as services to U.K. and Canadian consumers. Additionally, in 2018 and beyond, we will incur increased information technology and security costs and capital expenditures related to actions to improve information technology security and network resilience globally. In 2018 and beyond, we will have increases in the ongoing run-rate of IT and security spending. We also expect to incur increased expenses for insurance, finance, compliance activities, and to meet increased legal and regulatory requirements. We also expect to incur increased costs to provide free services to consumers, including increased customer support costs. The ultimate amount of these increases is yet to be determined but we expect them to be significant. As a result of the cybersecurity incident, we are subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in Part I, "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." While we believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of such proceedings and investigations based on the early stage of these proceedings and investigations, that alleged damages have not been specified, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”), as signed by the President of the United States on December 22, 2017, significantly revises U.S. tax law. The legislation will positively impact the Company’s ongoing effective tax rate due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Tax Act makes major changes to the U.S. international tax system. Under previous law, foreign earnings were subject to U.S. tax when repatriated to the U.S. Under the Tax Act, foreign earnings are generally exempt from U.S. tax. Additionally, there is a one-time deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings and profits (the “transition tax”). The Tax Act imposes other U.S. taxes on “global intangible low taxed income” and “base erosion anti-abuse transactions.” Other significant changes include limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, and repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities. As a result of the current interpretation and estimated impact of the Tax Act, the Company recorded adjustments totaling a net tax benefit of $48.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to provisionally account or the estimated impact. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

The economic environments impacting five of our six largest international operations, in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Argentina, and Chile, are expected to strengthen in 2017 relative to 2016. In Spain, economic growth is expected to remain good in 2017, although somewhat slower than in 2016. In addition, at their current levels, weaker foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year, will negatively impact both growth in revenue and profit when reported in U.S. dollars. Over the long term, we expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation, business execution, enterprise growth initiatives, technology infrastructure, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long-term multi-year average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long-term business strategy. We also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage.

Demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity, to consumer credit activity, to a lesser extent small commercial credit and marketing activity, in addition to our initiatives to expand our product offering and markets served. In 2014, the United States experienced modest growth in overall economic activity and a year-over-year decline in consumer mortgage activity. In this environment, Equifax revenue growth continued to benefit from our product development and market initiatives which more than offset the declines in mortgage related revenues. In 2015, we continue to expect modest growth in overall economic activity and consumer credit. We expect mortgage market origination activity to grow modestly for the year, largely in the first half, due to continued low interest rates. Internationally, the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political, fiscal and economic issues. In addition, continued weakening in foreign exchange rates will negatively impact growth in revenue and profit when reported in U.S. dollars. Offsetting these challenges, we expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation, business execution, enterprise growth initiatives, technology infrastructure, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long-term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long term business strategy.

Demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity, to consumer credit activity, to a lesser extent small commercial credit and marketing activity, and to our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served. In 2013, in the United States, we experienced modest growth in overall economic activity and in general consumer credit, a moderate year-over-year decline in consumer mortgage activity, and continuing benefits from our internal product and market initiatives. As expected, after growing in the first half of 2013, total company mortgage related revenues declined significantly in the second half of 2013, a trend we expect will continue into the first half of 2014. As a result, our Mortgage Solutions business unit’s rate of year-over-year revenue growth slowed in 2013 and the mortgage-related components of revenue included in USCIS’ Online Consumer Information Solutions and Workforce Solutions’ Verification Services each declined in absolute terms compared to 2012.  While we continue to expect modest growth in overall economic activity and general consumer credit to continue in 2014, mortgage market origination activity is expected to continue declining due to elevated interest rates. Internationally, the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political, fiscal and economic issues. In addition, recent weakening in foreign exchange rates of certain of the countries in which we participate will reduce growth in revenue and profit when reported in U.S. dollars. Offsetting these challenges, we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation, business execution, enterprise growth initiatives, technology infrastructure, and continuous process improvement will enable us, in a modestly growing economy, to deliver long-term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long term business strategy. We also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage. In 2014, we expect to offset the negative growth in mortgage-related revenues with strong revenue growth in our core, non-mortgage market initiatives.

Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Consumer and small business lending activity, is one of the key drivers of demand for our services. Lending activity is now growing at a moderate rate in most loan categories and markets around the world, but lenders continue to demonstrate caution in loan decisions due to continuing concerns about consumer and small business credit quality and about home values.  Mortgage lending activity, which is an important lending category for our company, is cyclical, based on fluctuations in both home sales and refinancing activity; and mortgage activity is currently below long term average activity levels, in part due to reduced home values. In addition, new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers and introduce new challenges as well as opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to our customers. Real time decision-making for many of our customers has become more complex and reliant on quality data assets with broad market coverage. Our proprietary technology is efficient and sufficiently flexible to adapt to a broad array of decisioning applications. By linking data assets, we are able to develop high value solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers’ decision-making activities. In an effort to respond to these market conditions, we have focused on the following activities: Further diversification of our revenues by pursuing and investing in key strategic initiatives including new product innovation, differentiated decisioning solutions and analytics, leveraging and broadening our diverse data assets and enhancing our technology platforms. Reorganizing our sales force with key customer teams dedicated to our largest accounts and broadening our product offerings to address the needs of our medium-to-smaller customers. Acquiring new data assets and technologies both domestically and internationally. Expanding and investing in attractive international markets, including Russia, India and Brazil. Continuing our focus on managing expenses through the use of LEAN and other process improvement initiatives. In 2012, we do not expect measurable improvement in the overall business environment. The environment will continue to be challenging as various countries deal with their particular political, budgetary, and economic issues. However, we currently expect that with our ongoing investments in new product innovation, technology infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, enterprise growth initiatives, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long term average organic revenue growth between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions, and we expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue as a result of operating and financial leverage. The diversity of our data assets, the strength of our analytical capabilities, and our proprietary decisioning technology has enabled us to consistently deliver high value solutions that our clients integrate into their business operations. As our clients' business environment becomes more difficult and competitive, these high value solutions will enable them to operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.

Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. Consumer and small business lending activity, which is one of the drivers of demand for our services, has stabilized in most markets around the world, but in most cases is not yet showing significant growth.  We expect growth in consumer lending to continue to lag the general economic recovery, particularly in the more mature markets.  In addition, new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers, introducing new challenges and opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to financial institutions. In an effort to respond to these challenges, we have focused on the following initiatives and activities: We are further diversifying our revenues by pursuing and investing in key strategic initiatives including new product innovation, differentiated decisioning solutions and analytics leveraging our diverse data assets and technology. We have reorganized our sales force and have key customer teams dedicated to our largest accounts. We have divested two product lines that were considered non-strategic, APPRO loan origination software and Direct Marketing Services. We continue to acquire new data assets and technologies and pursue international expansion. We continue to focus on managing our expenses through the use of LEAN, Work Out and other process improvement initiatives. For 2011, the operating environment will continue to create challenges for the marketing and growth of our traditional products and services, but will also create new opportunities for our more recently developed products which leverage our diverse data assets, analytical capabilities and technology to improve customers' decisioning capabilities and risk management activities.  In 2011, we expect improvements in the credit economy to be modest and therefore not contribute measurably to organic growth. However, we do expect to derive organic growth through our new product offerings and from the momentum we achieved as a result of our performance in 2010.

Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. We continue to be challenged by a difficult operating environment, causing a reduction in revenue for certain traditional credit-related services. Also, increased regulation is introducing new complexity in the marketing of product and service offerings to financial institutions and increasing compliance requirements for our customers. Accordingly, we are further diversifying our revenues by pursuing and investing in key strategic initiatives including new product innovation, differentiated decisioning solutions leveraging our diverse data assets and technology, acquiring new data assets and technologies, and international expansion. We are also focused on managing our expenses through the use of LEAN, Workout and other process improvement initiatives in order to maintain operating margins, earnings performance, and cash flow. For 2010, we anticipate GDP growth to be modest, but improving; employment to see slight improvement during the second half of the year; and home prices to continue to face pressure due to foreclosures. We anticipate increasing interest for our services from credit card issuers as the new credit card regulatory changes became effective in February of this year. As a result, we expect to see revenue growth gradually improve in 2010. Given our outlook and current foreign exchange rates, we expect operating results to be stable at their current levels during the first half of the year, with some increase in performance during the second half. The decrease in revenue for 2009, as compared to 2008, was primarily due to continued global economic weakness, which significantly impacted demand for our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, International and North America Personal Solutions business units when compared to 2008, as well as the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency negatively impacted 2009 revenue by $48.9 million, or 3%. This decrease was partially offset by strength in our TALX segment and Mortgage Solutions business within U.S. Consumer Information Solutions. For additional information about revenue fluctuations and operating income by segment, see "Segment Financial Results" below. 2008 revenue increased 5%, or $92.7 million, compared to 2007 primarily due to the full year inclusion of TALX, which was acquired on May 15, 2007. Revenue in our four other business units collectively declined by $33.0 million, or 2%, as growth in our International, North America Personal Solutions and North America Commercial Solutions segments through the first nine months of the year was able to partially, but not fully, offset an 8% decline in our USCIS business. Although the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on 2008 full year revenue growth was minimal, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to 2007 exchange rates negatively impacted fourth quarter revenue growth.

Our revenue stream is diversified among individual consumers and among businesses across a wide range of industries and international geographies. During 2008, the financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility around the world. Many of our customers, especially financial institutions, are encountering much uncertainty, which limits our visibility into their future plans and activities. A number of our customers have reduced their level of activity as a result of continued weakening of the U.S. and U.K. economies in particular. Additionally, there has been more significant activity related to the consolidation of financial institutions, including the recent acquisitions of Wachovia by Wells Fargo, of Countywide Financial by Bank of America and Washington Mutual by JPMorgan Chase. In the past, we have been impacted by industry consolidation. While average core product unit prices tend to decline as a result of consolidation, we look to negotiate higher volumes and capitalize on opportunities to sell additional products and services to offset the decline in prices. However, given significant financial stress impacting financial markets and reduced willingness to extend credit, past experience may or may not continue in the current market. Given the slowing global economic growth and challenging business environment, we continue to focus on our initiatives to reduce and manage our expenses, while trying to preserve our operating margins, earnings performance and cash flows from operations. Also, we continue to realign our resources to pursue key strategic objectives, including new product innovation and international expansion. Based on the uncertainty in the global economy, assuming exchange rates remain at levels consistent with December 31, 2008, we expect revenue in the first quarter of 2009 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2008.

Our financial condition and operating performance are affected by the rate at which the economies of the U.S. and the other countries in which we operate grow, as well as levels of consumer spending and confidence regarding jobs, the health of the economy and the unemployment rate. Changes in overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate generally impact the demand for consumer credit and accordingly for our credit information, marketing services, employment and income information, as well as other products and services. We do not expect meaningful improvement in revenue from our USCIS business in 2008. We do, however, expect our other operating segments to grow revenues when compared to 2007 due to new product innovation, attracting new customers and growing volumes with our existing customers. The demand for our services is influenced by price and service competition among a limited number of providers; investment in proprietary credit information databases; changes in customer requirements; continued consolidation in the lending, credit card and telecommunications industries; emerging new market segments; and technological innovation. To improve our competitive position requires that we continue to focus on developing applications to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors; efficient operational processing to offset price compression; competitive pricing; technological competence; and protection of sensitive data. Other significant factors include brand recognition, customer responsiveness and service quality, ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and regulatory compliance. We expect to be able to respond to these challenges by focusing on these strategic objectives: Increase penetration of our customers' information solutions needs through new products, value-based pricing, expanded services and improved sales and customer support; Deploy enabling technology systems and analytics globally; Invest in unique data sources; and Pursue new vertical markets and expand into emerging markets.

Changes in overall economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, generally impact the demand for consumer credit and accordingly for our credit information, as well as other products and services. These effects are dynamic and complex. The credit information business is characterized by price and service competition among a limited number of providers; investment in proprietary credit information databases; changes in customer requirements; continued consolidation in the lending, credit card and telecommunications industries; emerging new market segments; and technological innovation. Being competitive requires an emphasis on efficient processing to offset price compression; technological competence; protection of sensitive data; devotion of significant resources to marketing; and developing applications to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors. Other significant factors include product cost, brand recognition, customer responsiveness, ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and regulatory compliance. Effective January 1, 2007, we implemented certain organizational changes as a result of a strategic review of our business. The changes to our internal structure changed our operating segments to the following: U.S. Consumer Information Solutions, North America Personal Solutions, North America Commercial Solutions and International. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions consists of the former Marketing Services and North America Information Services, excluding U.S. Commercial Services and Canada. North America Commercial Solutions represents our former commercial business for the U.S. and Canada that was within North America Information Services as well as our October 2006 acquisition of Austin-Tetra. International consists of Canada (the consumer business), Europe and Latin America. North America Personal Solutions remains unchanged. We will present our financial results under this new organizational structure in our quarterly report for the period ending March 31, 2007. Our financial results for all periods presented in the Form 10-K are stated under the prior organization structure since that is how the Company was managed during all periods presented. The discussion of operating results by segment below is based on the organizational structure in place prior to January 1, 2007. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we analyzed our business to develop our growth strategy through 2010. Based on this analysis of our business, our growth strategy includes the following: Increasing our share of our customers’ spending on information-related services through the development and introduction of new products, pricing our services in accordance with the value they create for customers, increasing the range of current services utilized by customers, and improving the quality of sales and customer support interactions with consumers; Increasing our customers’ use of our proprietary analytical, predictive and enabling technology; Investing in and developing new, differentiated data sources that provide unique value to customers in their highest value decisioning needs; and Expanding into key emerging opportunities via acquisitions, partnerships, and/or internal development, including related markets in the United States, such as initiatives in the commercial, collections, and healthcare markets, as well as new geographic markets outside the United States. We are also committed to improving our operating efficiency through our organizational realignment by reducing layers of management, utilizing Global Centers of Excellence, and better aligning of our business units, which includes a sales structure that is more customer-focused. Some of the specific initiatives required to execute this strategy may result in an increase in capital expenditures or cash investment in future periods.

We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial affairs through a portfolio of products that we sell directly and indirectly via the Internet and other marketing channels of distribution. We collect, organize and manage numerous types of credit, financial, public record, demographic and marketing information regarding individuals and businesses. This information originates from a variety of sources including financial or credit granting institutions, which provide loan and accounts receivable information; governmental entities, which provide public records of bankruptcies, liens and judgments; and consumers who participate in surveys and submit warranty registration cards from which we gather demographic and marketing information. Our proprietary databases contain information on more than 400 million consumers and businesses worldwide. The original data is compiled and processed utilizing our proprietary software and systems and distributed to customers in a variety of user-friendly and value-add formats. During 2005, in order to continue to grow our credit data business, we acquired the credit files, contractual rights to territories (generally states or integration areas) and customer relationships of two independent credit reporting agencies in the U.S. and one in Canada that house consumer information on our system. We have developed analytical tools for customers to use in their consumer and commercial oriented decisioning activities. These decisioning activities include numerous types of consumer interactions including customer acquisition, relationship management (e.g., up-selling and cross-selling) and risk management. Our enabling technologies include products such as ePort, APPLY, Decision Power, ID Authentication, Accel CM, Accel DM and InterConnect. These platforms are generally distributed using the application service provider model to allow for ease of integration into customers’ in-house technology systems and to leverage our extensive technological systems and communication networks. We anticipate that our acquisitions in (1) March 2005 of APPRO Systems, Inc. (“APPRO”), a leading provider of enabling technologies for consumer and commercial lending operations, and (2) August 2005 of BeNow, Inc. (“BeNow”), a provider of leading edge solutions to multi-channel marketers, will help drive future growth in this market. We are organized and report our business results in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Latin America. The North America segment consists of three operating segments: Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions. The Europe and Latin America reportable segments are made up of varying mixes of three product lines: Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions. Information Services revenue is principally transaction related and is derived from our sales of the following products, of which a significant majority are delivered electronically: credit reporting and scoring, mortgage reporting, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services, and certain of our decisioning products that facilitate and automate a variety of credit oriented decisions. Marketing Services revenue is derived from sales of products that help customers acquire new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and manage portfolio risk. Personal Solutions revenue is transaction and subscription based, and is derived from sales of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver to consumers through mail delivery and electronically via the Internet. For additional information regarding our geographic business units and operating segments, including detailed financial results, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K as well as further discussion below within MD&A. We operate in 13 countries: North America (the U.S., Canada and Costa Rica), Europe (the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Peru and Uruguay). We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. Our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest customer only providing slightly more than 2% of total revenues. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors, such as demand for, and price of, our services, technological competitiveness, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements governing privacy and use of data and general economic conditions. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, operating revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, capital expenditures and cash provided by operating activities. We monitor these indicators, and our corporate governance practices, to ensure that business vitality is maintained and effective control is exercised. Looking forward, we believe that the performance of our business units in 2005, discussed in detail below, positions our company well for 2006. In 2006, we expect continued U.S. economic expansion, although at a slightly lower growth rate than in 2005 and 2004. During 2006, we expect: U.S. Consumer and Commercial Services to continue its solid performance. We serve a diverse group of industries and applications within those industries which should allow this business to continue to grow and deliver a solid financial performance. The value added services, including Predictive Sciences and enabling technologies, will continue to drive revenue growth. Marketing Services’ performance will primarily be driven by financial institutions’ activities in acquiring, managing and collecting their account portfolios. As the economy continues to expand, this business should continue to grow in 2006. Personal Solutions to continue to grow in 2006, aided by consumers’ increased focus on identity theft and fiscal responsibility, which drives demand for our products and services. Latin America to continue its solid performance, although at a more moderate rate than 2005. Latin America’s financial performance improved dramatically in 2005 due to increased volume and higher pricing. In addition, new value-add products and services contributed to revenue growth and improved competitive position in 2005. Europe to continue to experience challenges due to the economic environment in the U.K. We also expect to see opportunities for growth through our ability to identify and enhance our customers’ decisioning intelligence to more effectively interact with, and serve, their customers; broadening our Personal Solutions offerings to consumers; and ultimately moving our own businesses further up the value chain from data to analytics and decisioning technology—the main driver of growth and differentiation in our North America and Latin America business units.

Our products and services include consumer credit information, information database management, marketing information, small business credit information, decisioning and analytical tools, and identity verification services which enable businesses to make informed decisions about extending credit or service, manage portfolio risk and develop strategies for marketing to consumers and small businesses. We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial affairs through a portfolio of products that we sell directly via the Internet and in various hard-copy formats. We currently operate in 12 countries: North America (the U.S. and Canada), Europe (the U.K., Ireland, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Peru and Uruguay). We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. Our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest customer providing less than 2% of total revenues. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors, such as demand for, and price of, our services, technological competitiveness, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, federal, state, foreign and regulatory requirements governing privacy and use of data, and general economic conditions. Since the early 1990’s, Equifax has developed analytical tools for customers to use in their consumer oriented decisioning activities. These decisioning activities include numerous types of consumer interactions including customer acquisition, relationship management, e.g., up-selling and cross-selling and risk management. Our enabling technologies include products such as Apply, Decision Power, ID Authentication and InterConnect. These platforms are developed in an Application Service Provider (ASP) format to allow for ease of integration into customers’ inhouse technology systems and to leverage Equifax’s extensive technological systems and communication networks. The Europe and Latin America reportable segments are made up of varying mixes of three product lines: Information Services, Marketing Services and Personal Solutions. Detailed financial results and segment information are provided in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Segment Information. Information Services revenues are principally transaction related, and are derived from our sales of the following products, many of which are delivered electronically: credit reporting and scoring, mortgage reporting, identity verification, fraud detection and modeling services, and certain of our decisioning products that facilitate pre-approved offers of credit that automate a variety of decisions. Revenues from our Marketing Services are derived from our sales of products that help customers acquire new customers. Personal Solutions revenues are transaction related, and are derived from our sales of credit reporting products and identity theft monitoring services, which we deliver to consumers electronically via the Internet and via mail. We see significant opportunities for growth through our ability to identify and enhance our customers’ decisioning intelligence to more effectively interact with, and serve, their customers; broadening our Personal Solutions offerings to consumers; and ultimately moving our own businesses further up the value chain from data to analytics and decisioning technology—the main driver of growth and differentiation in our North American business units. Our corporate strategy as discussed above, is being executed in each of our business segments, providing our customers the ability to make decisions about their customers in ‘real-time’ at the point of interaction. Management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. These indicators include measurements of revenue growth, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share, capital expenditures and cash flow. The monitoring of these indicators, as well as Equifax’s corporate governance practices, is used to ensure that business vitality is maintained and effective control is exercised.
.@0000033185.@EFX.@2004-03-11.@Our revenues of $1.2 billion in 2003 increased 10% from 2002. In 2003, Equifax North America accounted for 83% of our total revenue and 89% of our operating income before corporate expense. Equifax North America revenues grew 13% in 2003, delivering an additional $112.8 million in revenue, compared to 6% growth in 2002. This growth was provided primarily by our Equifax North America reporting segment and driven by volume increases across our Information Services and Consumer Direct operating segments. Information Services growth was fueled by 12% growth in our US consumer and commercial services business primarily due to higher volumes and market share primarily from our financial services and telecommunications customers and by 30% growth in our Mortgage Services due to higher refinancing volumes when compared to 2002. Marketing Services was flat when compared to 2002. Consumer Direct revenues grew 76% and accounted for 27% of our 2003 growth, when compared to 2002 due to continued growth in consumer subscriptions and number of transactions. International revenues increased $7.7 million, or 4%, driven by currency fluctuations and growth in the United Kingdom and Brazil. The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly in Europe, positively impacted consolidated revenue by $20.4 million or 2%. Consolidated operating expenses in 2003 of $913.4 million increased $155.4 million, or 21%, over 2002. This increase is primarily the result of volume increases in correlation to revenue growth, expenditures (including a 4th quarter 2003 charge) related to the integration of our eMarketing business into our Direct Marketing Services product line, operations of our eMarketing business and new growth initiatives. Volume growth in our Information Services and Consumer Direct operating segments accounted for $53.4 million, or 34%, of our expense growth. Expenses associated with our eMarketing business accounted for $37.5 million, or 24%, of our total expense growth. In the second quarter of 2003 in our eMarketing business, $4.3 million in purchased data that was determined to be of no value and $4.2 million in receivables that were determined to be uncollectible were written off. We severed our relationship with those members responsible for these write-offs. In the fourth quarter of 2003, to bring eMarketing costs in line with eMarketing revenue, we recorded a $25.8 million asset impairment and restructuring charge (see Note 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) to complete the consolidation of eMarketing services into Direct Marketing Services. Of this $25.8 million charge, $22.6 million related to the write-down of eMarketing assets and $3.2 million related to restructuring costs. We believe that these asset write-downs, personnel reductions and facility consolidations provide an efficient operating structure for future periods. When combined, the $37.5 million associated with incremental eMarketing operating expenses and the $25.8 million in eMarketing asset write-downs and restructuring costs, accounted for $63.3 million or 41% of our total expense growth. Small Business Services and Direct Marketing Services combine for the predominate source of remaining expense growth for the year. Compared to 2002, we reduced consolidated headcount by 244 full time equivalents across business units in a continuing drive to generate incremental operating efficiencies on a consolidated basis. Cost of services in 2003 of $512.9 million increased $85.3 million or 20%. Costs of services as a percent of total operating revenue were 42% in 2003 versus 39% in 2002. Higher unit volumes in our U.S. Consumer and Commercial Services, Mortgage Services and Consumer Direct businesses were the primary causes of this increase. Additionally, there were incremental eMarketing costs which were exacerbated by acquisition integration costs. Excluding eMarketing's contribution to the increase of cost of services as a percent of total revenue, the percentage decreases from 42% to 39%, more in line with historical patterns. SG&A expenses of $274.6 million increased 10% over 2002, driven primarily by eMarketing SG&A. As a percent of total operating revenues, SG&A decreased to 22% for the year from 23% last year. Excluding incremental eMarketing SG&A of $15.2 million, the percent of total SG&A to revenue decreases to 21%. In addition to the $25.8 million in charges related to eMarketing that were recorded in December 2003, there was an additional $4.8 million that related to the write-down of capitalized assets tied to other software development investments, for a combined $30.6 million in asset impairment and restructuring charges. Operating income for 2003 decreased by $39.3 million, or 11%, to $312.0 million, as the $30.6 million in asset impairment and restructuring charges and $33.8 million in eMarketing operating losses produced an operating margin of 25% compared to 32% in 2002. Excluding these items, operating income would have increased by $25.1 million and margins would have been 31%, or more in line with historical results.
.@0000033185.@EFX.@2003-03-28.@As a leading source of consumer and commercial credit information, we collect, organize and manage various types of financial, demographic, and marketing information. Our products and services enable businesses to make credit and service decisions, manage their portfolio risk, and develop marketing strategies concerning consumers and commercial enterprises. We serve customers across a wide range of industries, including the financial services, mortgage, retail, telecommunications, utilities, automotive, brokerage, healthcare and insurance industries, as well as state and federal governments. We also enable consumers to manage and protect their financial health through a portfolio of products offered directly to individuals. We have approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, and manage our business globally through the following three operating segments: Equifax North America, Equifax Europe, and Equifax Latin America. Our operations are predominantly located within the United States, with foreign operations principally located in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Our products and services are categorized as follows: Information Services, Marketing Services, and Consumer Direct. Our Information Services products and services allow customers to make credit decisions about consumers and commercial enterprises. Our Marketing Services information products and databases enable customers to identify a target audience for marketing purposes, and our Consumer Direct products and services provide information to consumers that enable them to reduce their exposure to identity fraud and to monitor their credit health. We develop, maintain, and enhance secured proprietary information databases through compilation of accounts receivable information about consumers and businesses that we obtain from a variety of sources, such as credit granting institutions, public record information, including bankruptcies, liens, and judgments, and marketing information from surveys and warranty cards. We process this information utilizing our information management systems and make it available to our customers in a user-friendly format. Our reported revenues of $1.1 billion in 2002 decreased 3% from 2001. Our adjusted revenues were even with 2002. In 2002, Equifax North America accounted for 81% of our total revenue and 91% of our operating income before corporate expense. Our revenue growth in 2002 was negatively impacted by a global economy that has continued to weaken. Equifax North America revenues grew 6% in 2002, delivering an additional $49.8 million in revenue, compared to 13% growth in 2001. Our 2002 revenue growth is attributable to increases in revenues from our Consumer Direct products, sales of Mortgage Services resulting from increased refinancing activity, and our acquisition of Naviant. International revenues declined $45.1 million or 18% driven by currency fluctuations, the decision to exit our commercial reporting business in Spain, and the decline of the Argentinean economy. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly in Latin America, negatively impacted consolidated revenue by $16.7 million or 2%. Consolidated operating expenses in 2002 of $758.0 million declined $127.2, million or 14% over 2001. Operating expense, as adjusted, decreased 1%, or $9.3 million. Excluding incremental operating expense from our Naviant acquisition, operating expenses declined 5%, driven by our continued focus on productivity improvements, discretionary expense control and our restructuring actions taken in 2001 after the Certegy spin-off. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we reduced our worldwide workforce 11% to approximately 5,200 employees, and in 2002, continued to drive productivity, resulting in an additional 5% decrease. Cost of services in 2002 of $427.6 million declined $23.4 million or 5%. The divestiture of our City Directory business in October 2001 accounted for $9.3 million of the reduction. As adjusted, cost of services declined 3%, driven by our decision to exit of our commercial credit reporting business in Spain, lower personnel expense and professional service fees partially offset with higher royalties and data purchases expense on higher unit volumes in Equifax North America. SG&A, expenses of $249.9 million declined nearly 7% over 2001, driven by the divestiture of City Directory. As adjusted, SG&A expense increased $4.5 million, or 2%, due to our Naviant acquisition. Our SG&A expense in 2002 was also negatively impacted by an increase of $4.3 million in bad debt expense, with the WorldCom bankruptcy representing the largest portion of such expense. Operating income in 2002 increased 38%, to $351.3 million, with operating margins of 32%. Operating income, as adjusted, grew 3%, driven by our focus on productivity and expense control. Equifax North America’s ability to maintain strong operating margins while investing in key growth initiatives and Equifax Europe’s improvement in margins from 4% to 10% in 2002, offset margin erosion in our Marketing Services operations in the U.S., profit deterioration in Equifax Latin America due to economic conditions in Argentina, and the reduction in income from our former lottery business.

.@0000033185.@EFX.@2002-03-12.@For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the Company's results, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Equifax Inc. is a leading source of consumer and commercial credit information worldwide. The Company provides to a wide range of customers information management, consumer credit information, marketing, business information, and identity verification services to enable credit and business decisions. The Company, through its Consumer Direct business, provides credit reporting and identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft. The Company is the market leader for credit information services in North America.  Equifax Inc.'s 2001 financial reporting was significantly impacted by the spin-off of its Payment Services business ("Certegy"), divestitures of non-core businesses ("Divested Operations"), and restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding these transactions, Equifax reported record revenues, earnings and cash flow for its core business, largely attributable to performance in its North American Information Services businesses. Significant 2001 financial highlights were: Consolidated revenues increased 8% to $1.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $1.15, before restructuring and other charges of $60 million (pre-tax). Consolidated operating margins were 29%. North American revenues increased 13% and operating income increased 14%. U.S. consumer reporting volumes grew 20%. The Consumer Direct business more than tripled revenues. Free cash flow grew to $208 million, a 72% increase over 2000.

We help businesses of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, merchants and partners in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australasia. FLEETCOR’s predecessor company was organized in the United States in 1986, and FLEETCOR had its initial public offering in 2010 (NYSE: FLT). FLEETCOR has two reportable segments, North America and International. We report these two segments as they align with our senior executive organizational structure, reflect how we organize and manage our employees around the world, manage operating performance, contemplate the differing regulatory environments in North America versus other geographies, and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results. Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. Our solutions are comprised of payment products, networks and associated services. FLEETCOR is a global payments company primarily focused on business to business payments. We simplify the way businesses manage and pay for expenses and operate in five categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Our products are focused on delivering a better, more efficient way to pay, through specialized products, systems, and payment and merchant networks. While the actual payment mechanisms vary from category to category, they are structured to afford control and reporting to the end user. The methods of payment generally function like a charge card, prepaid card, one-time use virtual card, and electronic RFID, etc. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics. Customers are primarily business to business, have recurring revenue models, specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high EBITDA margins, and have similar selling systems, which can be leveraged in each business. Additionally, we provide other payment products including fleet maintenance, employee benefits and long haul transportation-related services. Our products are used in 82 countries around the world, with our primary geographies being the U.S., Brazil and the United Kingdom, which combined accounted for approximately 88% of our revenue in 2018. FLEETCOR uses both proprietary and third-party networks to deliver our payment solutions. FLEETCOR owns and operates proprietary networks with well-established brands throughout the world, bringing incremental sales and loyalty to affiliated merchants. Third-party networks are used to broaden payment product acceptance and use. In 2018, we processed approximately 2.9 billion transactions within these networks, of which approximately 1.4 billion were related to our Gift product line. FLEETCOR capitalizes on its products’ specialization with sales and marketing efforts by deploying product-dedicated sales forces to target specific customer segments. We market our products directly through multiple sales channels, including field sales, telesales and digital marketing, and indirectly through our partners, which include major oil companies, leasing companies, petroleum marketers, value-added resellers (VARs) and referral partners. We believe that our size and scale, product breadth and specialization, geographic reach, proprietary networks, robust distribution capabilities and advanced technology contribute to our industry leading position. We operate in two segments, which we refer to as our North America and International segments. Our revenue is generally reported net of the cost for underlying products and services. In this report, we refer to this net revenue as “revenue". See “Results of Operations” for additional segment information. Results presented for 2018 reflect the impact of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("Topic 606") ("ASC 606") and related cost capitalization guidance, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in the classification of certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense net with revenues. As a result of the application of the modified retrospective transition method, the Company's prior period results within its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q will not be restated to reflect the impact of Topic 606. The adoption of Topic 606 had the impact of reducing revenues by approximately $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Such expenses were not reflected as a reduction of revenues in the 2017 and 2016 amounts presented. This lack of comparability should be considered in reviewing the transaction analysis and the various breakdowns of revenue by geography, product and source in this discussion and analysis.

.@0000034903.@FRT.@2019-02-13.@We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, California, and South Florida. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 24.1 million square feet. In total, the real estate projects were 94.6% leased and 93.6% occupied at December 31, 2018. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 51 consecutive years. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our comparable property portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.  Our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals, changes in portfolio occupancy, and the redevelopment of those assets. Over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates. We continue to see strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces; however, the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer, as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decision-making process. We have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces. Additionally, we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces, and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants closing early and/or filing for bankruptcy. We believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment. However, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. At December 31, 2018, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.7% of annualized base rent. Our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. We currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately $210 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years. We continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at Santana Row and are under construction on an eight story 301,000 square foot office building which will include an additional 18,000 square feet of retail space and 1,300 parking spaces. The building is expected to cost between $205 and $215 million, to be delivered in 2019, and the office portion is 100% pre-leased. After current phases, we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321,000 square feet of commercial space. Additionally, we control 12 acres of land across from Santana Row, which has approximately 1 million square feet of commercial space entitlements. Construction continues on Phase II of Assembly Row which includes approximately 161,000 square feet of retail space, 447 residential units, and a 158 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner). Total expected costs range from $290 million to $305 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2019. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 120,000 square feet of retail space and the 158 room hotel have opened, and all of the residential units have been completed. Phase II also includes 122 for-sale condominium units, of which 107 have closed as of December 31, 2018. The remaining 15 units are expected to close in 2019. The condominium units have an expected total cost of $81 million. Additionally, Partners HealthCare built a 741,500 square foot office building as part of Additionally, we commenced construction on Phase III of Assembly Row, which will include 277,000 square feet of office space (of which, 150,000 square feet is pre-leased), 56,000 square feet of retail space, 500 residential units, and over 800 additional parking spaces. The expected costs for Phase III are between $465 million and $485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2022. Construction also continues on Phase II of Pike & Rose which includes approximately 216,000 square feet of retail space, 272 residential units, and a 177 room boutique hotel (owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner). As of December 31, 2018, approximately 190,000 square feet of retail space and the 177 room hotel have opened, and all of the residential units have been completed. Total expected costs range from $200 million to $207 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we closed on the sale of 69 of the 99 for-sale condominium units in Phase II. The condominiums have an expected total cost of $62 million. Additionally, at Pike & Rose, we commenced construction on a 212,000 square foot office building (which includes 4,000 square feet of ground floor retail space), and will include over 600 additional parking spaces. The building is expected to cost between $128 million and $135 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021. We invested $82 million in Assembly Row and Pike & Rose in 2018 and expect to invest between $175 million and $200 million in Assembly Row and Pike & Rose in 2019. The development of future phases of Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. We may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downREIT units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales. At December 31, 2018, the leasable square feet in our properties was 94.6% leased and 93.6% occupied. The leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies.

Total expected costs range from $200 million to $207 million and delivery is expected in 2017/2018. The hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner. Phase II will also include 99 for-sale condominium units with an expected cost of $53 million to $58 million. We invested $100 million in Pike & Rose in 2016 and expect to invest between $105 million and $130 million in Pike & Rose in 2017. The development of future phases of Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. We may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downREIT units as well as through new or assumed mortgages. At December 31, 2016, the leasable square feet in our properties was 93.3% occupied and 94.4% leased. The leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies.
.@0000034903.@FRT.@2016-02-09.@We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as in California and South Florida. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 90 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 21.4 million square feet. In total, the real estate projects were 94.3% leased and 93.5% occupied at December 31, 2015. A joint venture in which we owned a 30% interest owned six retail real estate projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet as of December 31, 2015. In total, the joint venture properties in which we owned a 30% interest were 93.6% leased and 85.3% occupied at December 31, 2015. On January 13, 2016, we acquired our partner's 70% interest in the joint venture and subsequently own 100% of the related properties. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 48 consecutive years. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-center portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments, and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our same-center growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. We have generally continued to see an encouraging operating environment for many of our tenants as well as strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces. While there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue, we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any negative changes in the economic environment. However, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. At December 31, 2015, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.9% of annualized base rent. Our properties are located primarily in densely populated and/or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. In 2016, we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately $154 million. We continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at Santana Row, and are currently proceeding with our next phase of redevelopment which is a six story building with 234,500 square feet of office space and 670 parking spaces. During the third quarter 2015, we executed a lease with Splunk Inc. for the entire building. The building is expected to cost between $110 and $115 million and stabilize in 2017. After current phases, we have approximately 9 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 634,000 square feet of commercial space. Additionally, we control an additional 12 acres of land adjacent to Santana Row. We continue to invest in the development at Assembly Row which is a long-term multi-phased mixed-use development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years. The carrying value of the development portion of this project at December 31, 2015 is approximately $395 million. The project currently has zoning entitlements to build 3.4 million square feet of commercial-use buildings, 1,843 residential units, and a 170 room hotel. The first phase consists of approximately 331,000 square feet of retail space and 98,000 square feet of office space (both owned by the Trust) and 445 residential units owned by AvalonBay Communities. The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) constructed the new orange line T-Stop at the property, which opened in September 2014. Minimal amounts of construction remain to be completed on the first phase. The retail space in Phase I opened during 2014 and currently is 100% leased. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, 74,000 square feet of office space is open, and we expect the remainder to open through the first half of 2016. Phase I is expected to stabilize in 2016. Total expected costs for Phase I of Assembly Row, net of reimbursements expected, range from $194 million to $196 million, of which $193 million has been incurred to date. We are also proceeding with development of Phase II of Assembly Row which will include 167,000 square feet of retail space, a 160 room boutique hotel and 447 residential units. The hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we will be a partner. Total expected costs range from $270 million to $285 million and stabilization is expected in 2018/2019. Construction commenced on Phase II in July 2015. Phase II is also expected to include 134 for-sale condominium units with an expected total cost of $70 million to $75 million. Additionally, as part of the second phase, we entered into a ground lease agreement with Partners HealthCare to bring more than 700,000 square feet of office space to Assembly Row. The ground lease agreement includes a purchase option. Partners HealthCare commenced construction on this new building in September 2014 and plans to relocate over 4,500 employees to Assembly Row starting in 2016. We invested $41 million in Assembly Row in 2015 and expect to invest between $100 million and $125 million in Assembly Row in 2016. Our Pike & Rose project in North Bethesda, MD, a long-term multi-phased mixed-use development project, currently has zoning entitlements to build 1.6 million square feet of commercial-use buildings and 1,605 residential units. Phase I of Pike & Rose includes 493 residential units, 157,000 square feet of retail space and 79,000 square feet of office space. In late June 2014, our 174 unit residential building opened and achieved stabilized occupancy in the 1st quarter 2015. As of December 31, 2015, 132,000 square feet of the retail space and 45,000 square feet of the office space in Phase I is open, and in July the first tenants moved into our 319 unit residential building. We expect the remaining retail, office and 319 unit residential building to open in early 2016, and expect Phase I to stabilize in 2016. Total expected costs for Phase I of Pike & Rose range from $265 million to $270 million of which $259 million has been incurred to date. Additionally, we are proceeding with development of Phase II of Pike & Rose and building construction has commenced. Phase II will include approximately 190,000 square feet of retail space, a 177 room select-service hotel and 272 residential units, as well as a pre-leased auto dealership building. Total expected costs range from $200 million to $207 million and stabilization is expected in 2018/2019. The hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we will be a partner. Phase II is also expected to include 104 for-sale condominium units with an expected cost of $53 million to $58 million. We invested $88 million in Pike & Rose in 2015 and expect to invest between $105 million and $130 million in Pike & Rose in 2016. The development of future phases of Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.

While we have seen improvements over much of our portfolio, we continue to see some tenants being negatively impacted by the economic environment and some filing for bankruptcy, though at a lower rate than in previous years.  We believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment, however, any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. During 2013, we expect to see increases in rental income as a result of our significant leasing activity over the past two years which resulted in higher occupancy starting in the latter half of 2012. We seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. At December 31, 2012, no single tenant accounted for more than 3.2% of annualized base rent. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. On occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downREIT units as well as through new or assumed mortgages. At December 31, 2012, the leasable square feet in our properties was 94.9% occupied and 95.3% leased. The leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies.
.@0000034903.@FRT.@2012-02-16.@We are an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) specializing in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, as well as in California. As of December 31, 2011, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 87 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 19.3 million square feet. In total, the real estate projects were 93.4% leased and 92.4% occupied at December 31, 2011. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 1.0 million square feet as of December 31, 2011. In total, the joint venture properties in which we own a 30% interest were 90.9% leased and occupied at December 31, 2011. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 44 consecutive years. Our properties are located in densely populated or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. In 2012, we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately $57 million. Additionally, we continue to invest in the development at Assembly Row which is a long-term development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years. The carrying value of the development portion of this project at December 31, 2011 is approximately $148 million. The project currently has zoning entitlements to build 2.3 million square feet of commercial-use buildings, 2,100 residential units, and a 200 room hotel. We expect that we will structure any future development in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include transfers of entitlements or co-developing with other companies. In December 2011, we entered into agreements with AvalonBay Communities ("AvalonBay") for a portion of the first phase of residential and retail development at Assembly Row which will include 575 residential units (by AvalonBay) and approximately 323,000 square feet of retail space.  The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) will also construct the new orange line T-Stop at the property.   We expect construction on Phase 1 to commence in early 2012 with stabilization in 2015. We will also continue our infrastructure work during 2012. We invested $36 million in Assembly Row in 2011 and expect to invest between $20 million and $40 million in 2012, net of expected public funding During 2011, we continued our predevelopment work related to the long-term redevelopment of Mid-Pike Plaza in Rockville, Maryland, which will become Pike & Rose, a long-term, multi-phased, mixed-use project.  The property currently has zoning entitlements to build 1.7 million square feet of commercial-use buildings and 1.7 million square feet for residential use. Phase I of Pike & Rose involves demolition of roughly 25% of the existing GLA at Mid-Pike Plaza and construction of 493 residential units, 151,000 square feet of retail space and 79,000 square of office space. We expect construction of Phase I to commence in 2012 with stabilization in 2015/2016.  We invested $7 million in Pike & Rose in 2011 and expect to invest between $15 million to $35 million in 2012.

On occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or downREIT units as well as through new or assumed mortgages. Our same-center growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. The current economic environment may, however, impact our ability to increase rental rates in the short-term and may require us to decrease some rental rates. This will have a long-term impact over the contractual term of the lease agreement, which on average is between five and ten years. We expect to continue to see small changes in occupancy over the short term and expect increases in occupancy to be a driver of our same-center growth over the long term as we are able to re-lease vacant spaces. We seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. At December 31, 2011, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.5% of annualized base rent. The current economic environment has impacted the success of certain of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from certain of our tenants. While we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment, any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We expect our occupancy rate will remain relatively flat in the short term. Since the latter part of 2010, we have seen signs of improvement for some of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces; however, there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue. We continue to monitor our tenants’ operating performances as well as trends in the retail industry to evaluate any future impact.

The regular common dividend was payable on January 15, 2008, to common shareholders of record as of January 2, 2008. We continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces as leases on these spaces expire. For example, leases signed in 2005, 2006 and 2007 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at double digit cash base rent increases. On spaces where the tenant leases are expiring over the next few years, our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that the base rents on new leases will have double-digit weighted average increases over the cash basis base rents currently in place. We anticipate investments in redevelopment projects of approximately $104 million and $55 million to stabilize in 2008 and 2009, respectively. As redevelopment properties are completed, spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue; in addition, spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases.

We anticipate further growth in earnings from the acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary markets in the East and West regions, as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in additional markets. Any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent, however, on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions.

However, our occupancy percentage and leased percentage decreased as of December 31, 2006 due to 93,000 square feet vacated as a result of the Chapter 7 liquidation of Tower Records and Storehouse Furniture. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies. Santana Row, located in San Jose, California, includes approximately 563,000 square feet of retail space, 295 residential rental units, and a ground lease to a 213-room hotel. The 295 residential units include 259 residential units delivered in 2005 and 2006 plus 36 pre-existing residential units. The 295 residential rental units do not include 219 units that have been sold as condominiums. Our total investment in Santana Row, excluding future phases, is approximately $431 million (which includes the 563,000 square feet of retail space, the 295 residential rental units, the related common areas and infrastructure and $13 million invested in restaurant ventures) net of insurance proceeds received related to the 2002 fire and proceeds from the sale of the 219 residential units. We are developing a master plan for the remaining parcels at Santana Row which comprise approximately 13.4 acres of land. Our remaining entitlements consist of approximately 135,000 square feet of retail space, 897 residential units and either a 191-room hotel or an additional 190 residential units. We are evaluating the feasibility of utilizing these entitlements in future development at Santana Row but there is no guaranty that we will ultimately pursue or complete any part of the development of the remaining parcels.

Changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions.
.@0000034903.@FRT.@2006-03-07.@We are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or had a majority interest in 103 community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties comprising approximately 17.6 million square feet. Our properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the United States, as well as in California, and one apartment complex in Maryland. In total, the 103 commercial properties were 96.3% leased at December 31, 2005. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2005. In total, the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 97.4% leased at December 31, 2005. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 38 consecutive years. We continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces that are experiencing tenant turnover. In 2006 and 2007, we anticipate that over 700,000 square feet of retail space that has been under redevelopment will stabilize. As redevelopment properties stabilize, spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue; in addition, spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases. Further, leases signed in 2004 and 2005 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at double digit base rent increases. Many of the leases with rents commencing in 2006 were signed in 2005 or earlier. On spaces where the tenant leases are expiring in 2006, our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that the base rents in new leases will have double-digit average increases over the base rents currently in place. At December 31, 2005 the leaseable square feet in our shopping centers was 93.9% occupied and 96.3% leased. The leased rate is higher than the occupancy rate due to spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. We believe that our occupancy rate will improve slightly in 2006 as tenants take possession of leased spaces, particularly in centers being redeveloped, but that our occupancy rate will always be below our leased rate as leased spaces are prepared for occupancy. Our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to acquisitions and the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects. Santana Row, located in San Jose, California, includes approximately 563,000 square feet of retail space, 292 residential rental units, and a ground lease to a 213-room hotel. The 292 residential rental units include 256 units that are being constructed and are expected to be complete in early to mid-2006 and 36 existing rental units. The 292 residential rental units do not include 219 units that have been sold as condominiums or are currently classified as held for sale. Our total investment in Santana Row, as currently under development, is anticipated to be $432 million (which includes the 563,000 square feet of retail space, the 292 residential rental units, the related common areas and infrastructure and $11 million invested in restaurant ventures) net of insurance proceeds received related to the 2002 fire and proceeds from the sale of the 219 residential units. We are developing a master plan for the remaining parcels at Santana Row which comprise approximately 13.4 acres of land. Our entitlements consist of approximately 120,000 square feet of retail space, 690 residential units and a 191-room hotel. We are evaluating the feasibility of utilizing these entitlements in future development at Santana Row but there is no guaranty that we will ultimately pursue or complete any part of the development of the remaining parcels. We anticipate further growth in earnings from acquisitions of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary markets in the East and West regions, as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions. Any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent, however, on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles.

.@0000034903.@FRT.@2005-03-07.@We are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership, management, development and redevelopment of high-quality retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or had a majority interest in 106 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixed-use properties comprising approximately 16.9 million square feet, located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States, as well as California and one apartment complex in Maryland. In total, the 106 commercial properties were 95.1% leased at December 31, 2004. A joint venture in which we own a 30% interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet as of December 31, 2004. We have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962, and have increased our dividend rate for 37 consecutive years. We believe that in 2005 we will experience growth in earnings from operations when compared to 2004. We expect this growth in earnings to be generated by a combination of the following: increased earnings in our same center portfolio, increased earnings from our real estate partnership established in July 2004. increased earnings as we expand our portfolio through property acquisitions, increased earnings as a result of improved occupancy and rental rates on retail and/or residential space at Santana Row, and Our earnings in 2003 and 2004 were positively impacted by the reimbursement to us of lost rents of $11.0 million from an insurance settlement received in December 2003 related to a fire at Santana Row in 2002. Of the $11 million reimbursement, approximately $8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2003 and approximately $3 million was recognized during 2004. Earnings in our same center portfolio are anticipated to grow as a recovering economy in each of our regions is expected to result in improved occupancy rates and increasing rents on lease rollovers. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Same Center” below for the definition of the properties that constitute our “same center” portfolio. The economic environment in the Northern California retail market, while improving, continues to be weak, resulting in lower occupancy rates and limiting our ability to increase rents in properties in that area. We believe the economies of our other markets are generally improving. Our same center growth has also been slowed during the past two fiscal years by the increase in our redevelopment activity at certain centers, which will, by design, keep leasable space out of service until the redevelopments are complete. The competitive retail environment has resulted in the loss of some of our anchor retailers, but we have been successful in replacing a number of those anchors and other weaker tenants with tenants that we believe are more credit worthy. In other cases, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to redevelop the space that became vacant when the anchor tenant vacated. While this redevelopment and retenanting activity has resulted in increased capital investment in those centers, it should also increase the rental income from new leases as these tenants commence operations, add to the economic life of the centers, and increase the appeal of the centers to retail customers. These factors should extend the number of years during which we can reasonably expect growth in earnings from those properties beyond the period we would have expected if we had not made the additional capital investment. The current development at Santana Row consists of four phases. Seven of the eight buildings of Phase I, which include retail, residential and a 213-room hotel, opened in 2002. The retail portion of the remaining building, “Building 7,” opened in early 2003. The delay in opening Building 7 was the result of a fire in August 2002 that destroyed all but 11 of the planned 246 residential units located on that building. The rebuilding of the residential rental units on Building 7 (Phase IV) commenced in 2004. We anticipate delivery of the units will start in 2005 and, when completed in 2006, Building 7 will add 96 townhomes and 160 flats. Phase II of the project, which includes approximately 84,000 square feet of retail space, was completed in late 2003 and Phase III, which consists of an arts cinema and 4,000 square feet of retail space, opened in August 2004. The total cost of Phase I is estimated to be $449 million (excluding the Building 7 reconstruction). The costs to date for Phase I are net of $129 million of insurance proceeds, $11 million of which was recognized as income in 2004 and 2003. The cost of Phase II is approximately $27 million. The total cost of Phase III is estimated to be approximately $5 million, and we estimate the cost Phase IV, will be approximately $58 million. We are exploring in 2005 the possibility of selling as many as 219 residential units at Santana as condominiums. In the event we determine it is financially feasible to sell residential units and we are able to obtain all necessary approvals, sales of units could begin in mid-2005. We anticipate further growth in earnings from continuing investments in our primary markets in the East and West regions, partly offset by selective dispositions. We expect to continue growth through acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in 2005 and beyond. This growth is contingent, however, on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative hurdles at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price which must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to finance the property acquisitions. As one method of enhancing our growth and strengthening our market share in the regions in which we operate, in July 2004, we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership in which we own 30% of the equity. The venture intends to acquire up to $350 million of stabilized, supermarket-anchored shopping centers in our East coast and West coast markets which will be financed through secured borrowings and equity contributions. We will be the manager of the venture and its properties, earning fees for acquisitions, management, leasing and financing. Through our partnership interest, we also will have the opportunity to earn performance-based income.
.@0001467858.@GM.@2019-02-06.@Our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform GM into the world's most valued automotive company. Our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous, data connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10% core margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis. In addition to our EBIT-adjusted margin improvement goal, through 2018 we fully realized our financial targets of $6.5 billion in total annual operational and functional cost savings compared to 2014 costs. For the year ending December 31, 2019 we expect EPS-diluted of between $5.17 and $6.00 and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.50 and $7.00. The following table reconciles expected EPS-diluted under U.S. GAAP to expected EPS-diluted-adjusted and includes the future impact of the expected adjustment related to transformation activities. We face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility, rising materials prices, trade policy and political uncertainty. As a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these challenges. We expect transformation activities to drive approximately $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, resulting from reductions in Automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements, as well as reduced capital expenditures. This target includes approximately $4.5 billion of cost savings, to be achieved through staffing, manufacturing and product initiatives. As we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. These additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations. We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other includes primarily foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," as amended (ASU 2014-09) on a modified retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. The impacts of the new standard are reflected in this MD&A. Refer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements or additional information. The most significant element of our Automotive and other cost of sales is material cost which makes up approximately two-thirds of the total amount. The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns. Factors which most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Refer to the regional sections of this MD&A for additional information on volume and mix. In the year ended December 31, 2018 unfavorable Cost was due primarily to: (1) increased raw material and freight costs related to carryover vehicles of $1.3 billion; (2) charges of $1.3 billion primarily related to employee separation charges and accelerated depreciation resulting from the transformation activities; (3) increased other costs of $1.2 billion primarily related to manufacturing, engineering and warranty; (4) increased material and freight costs of $1.2 billion related to vehicles launched within the last twelve months incorporating significant exterior and/or interior changes (Majors); and (5) a net increase in charges of $0.7 billion primarily related to asset impairments and employee separation charges in Korea in 2018, partially offset by restructuring actions in India and South Africa in 2017; partially offset by (6) favorable material performance of $1.1 billion related to carryover vehicles. In the year ended December 31, 2018 favorable Other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Brazilian Real and other currencies, partially offset by the strengthening of various currencies against the U.S. Dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2017 favorable Cost was due primarily to: (1) decreased warranty costs of $1.4 billion; (2) decreased employee related costs of $0.8 billion; (3) decreased material and freight costs of $0.7 billion related to carryover vehicles; and (4) decreased restructuring costs related to UAW cash severance incentive program of $0.2 billion in 2016 that did not recur in 2017; partially offset by (5) increased material and freight costs of $1.4 billion related to Majors; (6) increased engineering costs of $0.7 billion; and (7) charges of $0.4 billion related to restructuring actions in India and South Africa. In the year ended December 31, 2017 unfavorable Other was due primarily to the foreign currency effect of $0.4 billion due to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and other currencies against the U.S. Dollar.

In addition to our EBIT-adjusted margin improvement goal, our overall financial targets include total annual operational and functional cost savings of $6.5 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs, of which approximately $5.5 billion has been realized as of December 31, 2017, and which will more than offset our planned incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products; and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A. For the year ending December 31, 2018 we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted to be in the mid-six dollar range. We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results. We expect core EBIT-adjusted and core adjusted automotive free cash flow to be in line with 2017. Core consists of all operations excluding our autonomous vehicle operations, including Cruise, Maven car sharing entities, and our investment in Lyft.

.@0001467858.@GM.@2017-02-07.@Our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve our goal of 9% to 10% margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis (EBIT-adjusted margins, calculated as EBIT-adjusted divided by Net sales and revenue) by early next decade: earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; lead in technology and innovation, including OnStar 4G LTE and connected car, alternative propulsion, urban mobility including ride- and car-sharing through Maven and our investment in Lyft, active safety features and autonomous vehicles; grow our brands, particularly the Cadillac brand in the U.S. and China and the Chevrolet brand globally; continue our growth in China; continue the growth of GM Financial into our full captive automotive financing company; and deliver core operating efficiencies. In addition to our EBIT-adjusted margin improvement goal, our overall financial targets include expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of $6.5 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs, of which approximately $4 billion has been realized as of December 31, 2016, and which we expect will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2017 and beyond; and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A. For the year ending December 31, 2017 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved total net sales and revenue, EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins that equal or exceed the corresponding amounts in 2016, ROIC-adjusted of greater than 25%, Automotive operating cash flow of approximately $15 billion, adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion and EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.00 and $6.50. We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results. We expect these financial results in part to be driven by favorable shifts in mix for our new or refreshed product launches, including crossovers. The following table reconciles expected automotive net cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP to expected adjusted automotive free cash flow (dollars in billions): We face continuing challenges from a market, operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty.

GMNA In the year ended December 31, 2016 industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 21.9 million units representing a 1.7% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to strong consumer demand driven by credit availability, low interest rates and low fuel prices. In the year ended December 31, 2016 our vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, totaled 3.0 million units for market share of 17.0%, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in our U.S. market share was driven primarily by lower fleet market share due to a planned reduction in rental deliveries, partially offset by higher retail market share. U.S. retail sales, generally more profitable than fleet sales, generated an increase of 0.5 percentage points in market share, primarily driven by Chevrolet. We achieved EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.1% during 2016 on continued strength of U.S. industry light vehicle sales, new product launches and material and other cost savings, which partially offset launch related costs. Based on our current cost structure, we continue to estimate GMNA’s breakeven point at the U.S. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 - 11.0 million units. We expect to sustain an EBIT-adjusted margin of 10% in 2017 on continued strength of U.S. industry light vehicle sales, key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings. GME As a result of moderate economic growth across Europe (excluding Russia) automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers continued improving in the year ended December 31, 2016 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 18.8 million units representing a 6.1% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Our European operations are benefiting from this trend and vehicle sales continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our Opel and Vauxhall retail vehicle sales of 1.2 million units for market share of 5.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 consistent with the corresponding period in 2015. We continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. Despite the improvements we experienced through most of 2016 we were unable to overcome the impacts of the U.K. referendum vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) resulting in a $0.3 billion unfavorable impact due primarily to adverse movement in the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. We anticipate the impacts of Brexit to continue through 2017. We also anticipate headwinds associated with industry pricing pressures and increased costs associated with depreciation, amortization, marketing and costs associated with our new product launches. We intend to mitigate these headwinds with the full benefit of our recently launched Astra and Mokka X along with the 2017 launches of the Insignia, Ampera E, and two new crossovers that we believe will substantially increase our competitiveness in this growing market. The German Ministry of Transportation and the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our German subsidiary, in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested, from time to time, written responses from our subsidiary on the subject. Our German subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines. In addition, the German and the EU Parliaments have instigated Inquiry Commissions into government agencies' oversight of emissions enforcement, requesting our German subsidiary's participation. At the same time, the German government has instigated further industry-wide inquiries about CO2 emissions. This scrutiny, regulatory changes and increased enforcement has led to increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us. GMIO In the year ended December 31, 2016 China industry sales were 28.3 million units, representing an increase of 12.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2016 our China wholesale volumes increased by 4.9% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Our market share decreased to 13.8%, down 1.1 percentage points as our volume growth was less than that of the industry. Strong growth in Cadillac, Buick and Baojun passenger vehicles, including SUVs, were partially offset by lower Chevrolet sales because of model changeover and lower Wuling sales because of a continued segment shift away from mini commercial vehicles. In the year ended December 31, 2016 our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $2.0 billion. We expect moderate industry growth in 2017 and continuation of pricing pressures which will continue to pressure margins. We continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong China equity income by focusing on vehicle mix improvements, cost improvements and efficiencies, and downstream performance optimization. A weaker economy due partially to lower oil prices and foreign exchange volatility, among other factors, negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East and led to industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 18.9 million units, representing a decrease of 3.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2016 our retail sales totaled 0.7 million units leading to a market share of 3.6%, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in retail sales volumes was due primarily to overall industry volume declines, foreign currency availability and economic challenges in the Middle East, Egypt and South Africa. In 2017 we expect the operating environment to remain challenging. As we strategically assess our performance and the manner in which we operate in certain countries, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations. GMSA The South American automotive industry continues to be challenged by weak economic conditions and lack of consumer confidence. Industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 3.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2016 representing a 12.3% decrease compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2016, our vehicle sales in Brazil, our largest market in South America, totaled 0.3 million units for market share of 16.9%, representing an increase of 1.8 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily driven by a refreshed portfolio. In 2017 we expect conditions in South America to improve as the economy recovers driven by higher consumer confidence and lower interest rates. We will continue to monitor conditions in South America and take actions to address challenges in the region. Corporate In connection with our capital allocation program, as detailed in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A, we previously announced that our Board of Directors had authorized programs to purchase up to $5 billion and $4 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016 and 2017. We completed the $5 billion program in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $1 billion of the $4 billion program in the three months ended December 31, 2016. In January 2017 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs. Through February 1, 2017 we had purchased 180 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $6.0 billion. The Ignition Switch Recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of U.S., federal, state and Canadian governments. In addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. Such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes.

Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Other includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) costs including manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and policy and warranty expense; (3) foreign exchange; and (4) non-vehicle related automotive revenues and costs as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.
.@0001467858.@GM.@2015-02-04.@Our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve 9% to 10% margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis (EBIT-adjusted margins, calculated as EBIT-adjusted divided by Net sales and revenue) by early next decade: (1) earn customers for life by developing a strong product pipeline, leading the industry in quality and safety and delivering on our commitments; (2) lead the industry in product design, with our light-weighting and mixed material body structures and in leading edge technology, including the launch of 4G LTE in China and expansion of OnStar to Europe; (3) grow our brands, particularly the Cadillac brand in the U.S. and China; (4) continue our growth in China; (5) continue our growth of GM Financial as our captive automotive financing company; and (6) deliver core operating efficiencies by institutionalizing Operational Excellence. Our financial targets include the following: Expected EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins improving in all automotive segments in 2015 due primarily to the following anticipated trends: (1) an approximately 3% increase in global industry vehicle sales; (2) improved mix of full-size SUVs and full-size pick-up trucks; and (3) lower overall restructuring costs; partially offset by (4) higher marketing and engineering costs; and (5) unfavorable foreign currency effects; Anticipated adjusted automotive free cash flow will be relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014; Forecasted consolidated EBIT-adjusted margins of 9% to 10% by the 2020s; Expected EBIT-adjusted margins of 10% in GMNA in 2016, which we anticipate will be driven by product launches, disciplined pricing and a focus on fixed costs; An anticipated return to profitability in GME in 2016 driven by investments in our product portfolio, a revised brand strategy and reducing material, development and production costs assuming Europe does not suffer another recession; Expected continued improvement of our results in GMIO (excluding the results of our China JVs) through our emerging market product portfolio, improvements in brand strategy and dealer networks, cost structure and sourcing over the medium term; Continued strong net income margins at our China JVs, with plans to invest approximately $14 billion in China through 2018 and increase vehicle sales volumes by nearly 40% by 2018; Expected continued improvement of our core operations in GMSA through product launches and material and logistics optimization, with a long-term objective of single digit EBIT-adjusted margins; and An anticipated increase of GM Financial’s support of the sale of new GM vehicles around the world through a comprehensive suite of financing products, including continuing on the path towards full global captive capability. We review changes in our results of operations under four categories: volume, mix, price and other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Other includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) costs including manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and policy and warranty expense; (3) foreign exchange; and (4) non-vehicle related automotive revenues and costs as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.
.@0001467858.@GM.@2014-02-06.@Our vision is to design, build and sell the world’s best vehicles. The primary elements of our strategy to achieve this vision are to: Deliver a product portfolio of the world’s best vehicles that includes cars, crossovers and trucks, allowing us to maximize sales under any market condition; Sell our vehicles globally by targeting developed markets, which are projected to have increases in vehicle demand as the global economy recovers, and further strengthening our position in high growth emerging markets; Improve revenue realization and maintain a competitive cost structure to allow us to remain profitable at lower industry volumes and across the lifecycle of our product portfolio; Maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing financial leverage given the high operating leverage of our business model; and ensure that our dealers and customers have consistently available, transparent and competitive financing options through GM Financial and other providers. We are committed to leadership in vehicle design, quality, reliability, telematics and infotainment and safety, as well as to developing key energy efficiency, energy diversity and advanced propulsion technologies, including electric vehicles. Our business is diversified across products and geographic markets. We meet the local sales and service needs of our retail and fleet customers with a global network of independent dealers. GMNA has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and sales and distribution operations in Central America and the Caribbean. GMNA represented 51.1% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in 2013 and we had the largest market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in North America at 16.9%. We grew our retail market share in all four brands as compared to 2012. Our market share growth was driven in part by the success of several product launches during the year, most notably the Corvette Stingray, Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac CTS and the all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size trucks. Our products in the region continued to receive recognitions of excellence including the most initial quality awards as determined by JD Power and Associates as compared to any other automotive manufacturer in 2013. GME has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations across Western and Central Europe. GME's wholesale vehicle sales volume, which in addition to Western and Central Europe, includes Eastern Europe (including Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States among others) represented 16.3% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in 2013. In 2013 we estimate we had the number four market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Europe at 8.3%. GMIO distributed Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe. These vehicles are reported within market share for Europe, but wholesale vehicle sales volume is recorded by GMIO. Our European operations continue to show signs of improvement underscored by our first Opel and Vauxhall market share increase in 14 years. This market share increase was partially driven by the successful launches of the Opel Mokka, ADAM and Cascada during 2013. Our focus on successfully executing product launches and containing costs has in part contributed to significant year-over-year reduction in EBIT (loss)-adjusted. In an effort to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in GME, we reached agreement with the labor union in Germany to terminate all vehicle and transmission production at our Bochum, Germany facility by the end of 2014. Affected employees will be eligible for a voluntary restructuring separation program. Restructuring charges will be recorded primarily through 2014. Refer to Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. GMIO has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations in Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe (including Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States among others). GMIO represented 16.2% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in 2013. The Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region is our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 40.0% of our global retail vehicle sales volume in 2013. In 2013 we estimate we had the number two market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa at 9.5%. In 2013 we had market share of 14.3% in China. GMIO records the wholesale unit volume and financial results of Chevrolet brand vehicles that it distributes and sells in Europe. Our international operations' results were highlighted by our continued strength in China where we sold over 3 million vehicles. Our strength in the market was in part driven by the successful launches of the new Cadillac XTS, the refreshed Buick LaCrosse and Regal and certain Wuling branded vehicles, as well as continued strong sales of the Buick Encore and Buick Excelle. Our Buick brand continues to be our strongest brand in China with 810,000 vehicles sold in 2013 an increase of 16% from the prior year. In addition we have been making investments in our Cadillac brand in China which included a new assembly plant in Shanghai. We are addressing many of the challenges in our GMIO operations and have performed strategic assessments on the performance and the manner in which we operate in certain countries. While we are continuing our strategic assessments we announced plans to discontinue offering mainstream Chevrolet vehicles in Europe in 2015 and recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges; announced plans to cease manufacturing at GM Holden Ltd., our subsidiary in Australia (Holden), and recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges; recorded asset impairment charges at GM India; and impaired our remaining goodwill in GMIO. Refer to the "GM International Operations" section of MD&A and Notes 9, 10 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our GM Korea subsidiary has continuing litigation with more than 10,000 current and former employees over the definition of ordinary wages. As a result of the recent Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea’s favorable decision on a very similar wage litigation case involving another company we now believe an unfavorable outcome on our case given the new precedent is no longer probable and we reversed certain accruals for our cases. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. GMSA has sales, manufacturing, distribution and/or financing operations in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela as well as sales and distribution operations in Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. GMSA represented 16.4% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in 2013. In 2013 GMSA derived 63.5% of its wholesale vehicle sales volume from Brazil. In 2013 we estimate we had the number one market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in South America at 17.5% and the number three market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Brazil at 17.3%. Despite foreign currency pressures and challenging political environments across the region, our South American operations experienced continued profitability in 2013 that was driven in part by successful product launches including the Chevrolet Onix, Prisma and Tracker. We have further addressed our cost structure through restructuring efforts and multi-year labor agreements in Brazil. Our Venezuelan operations highlight some of the foreign currency and political pressures. In 2013 the Venezuelan government announced a change in the official fixed exchange rate which resulted in devaluation charges during the year. In addition to currency controls already in place, the Venezuelan government announced pricing controls that, taken with other initiatives, require us to closely monitor and consider our ability to manage and control our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Refer to the "GM South America" section of MD&A for additional information. We continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. Initiatives during 2013 included lowering our cost of capital and increased financial flexibility by issuing $4.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. We used proceeds from the issuance to prepay notes issued to the Canadian Health Care Trust (HCT) and to purchase 120 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock from the New VEBA. Refer to Notes 14 and 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. As part of an effort to release capital from non-core assets and further enhance our financial flexibility we sold our common equity ownership in Ally Financial and our seven percent equity interest in PSA held by GME. Refer to Notes 5 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The United States Treasury divested its remaining ownership stake in our common stock. Also, all of our shares of Series B Preferred Stock mandatorily converted into 137 million shares of our common stock and will result in future annual cash preferred stock dividend savings. Refer to Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Through ongoing discussions with taxing authorities we remeasured an uncertain tax position resulting in a tax benefit that will reduce future cash taxes. Our collective actions during 2013 have helped us achieve investment grade status with a rating agency and we were added to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500. We anticipate the 2014 global automotive industry to be up approximately 2% over 2013 or about 85 million vehicles. For 2014 we expect our biggest challenges will be associated with unfavorable foreign currency pressures and planned global restructuring charges of up to $1.1 billion. However we expect to substantially offset these challenges with favorable pricing and by leveraging our continued strength in North America and China. We continue to progress toward our target of mid- to high-single digit margins for mid-decade and expect our 2014 EBIT-adjusted margins to be comparable to 2013. We are also committed to returning capital to our common stockholders and in January 2014 our Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock in the amount of $0.30 per share payable in March 2014.
.@0001467858.@GM.@2013-02-15.@Our Company commenced operations on July 10, 2009 when we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Old GM through a 363 Sale under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. By commencing operations following the 363 Sale, we were able to take advantage of a competitive labor agreement with our unions, a restructured dealer network and a reduced and refocused brand strategy in the U.S. focused on four brands. In November and December of 2010 we consummated a public offering of 550 million shares of our common stock and 100 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and listed both of these securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the common stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In April 2011 in connection with MLC's distribution of warrants for our common stock to its unsecured creditors, we listed the warrants expiring July 10, 2016 and the warrants expiring July 10, 2019 on the New York Stock Exchange. Management believes EBIT-adjusted provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments' operating results because it excludes interest income, expense and income taxes as well as certain additional amounts. Management does not consider these excluded items when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization, its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources, such as capital investment, among business units and for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Such adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill and certain investments, gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of non-core investments. Management believes this measure allows it to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions. We believe EBIT-adjusted is useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and is therefore used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. While management believes that EBIT-adjusted provides useful information, it is not an operating measure under U.S. GAAP and there are limitations associated with its use. Our calculation of EBIT-adjusted may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of EBIT-adjusted has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other measures such as Net income or Net income attributable to stockholders. Due to these limitations, EBIT-adjusted is used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures. Management believes income before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding GM Financial's operating results. GM Financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. In 2012 we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt within Corporate for segment reporting purposes, and they are excluded from EBIT-adjusted. Previously gains and losses on extinguishment of debt were recorded within the applicable automotive segments. This change is consistent with how management currently views the results of our operations. The following tables summarize the reconciliation of our automotive segments EBIT-adjusted and GM Financial's income before income taxes to Net income attributable to stockholders and provides supplemental detail of the adjustments, which are presented net of noncontrolling interests (dollars in millions): In the year ended December 31, 2012 Total net sales and revenue increased by $2.0 billion (or 1.3%) due primarily to: (1) favorable vehicle mix of $3.7 billion; (2) favorable vehicle pricing effect of $1.6 billion; (3) increased wholesale volumes of $1.5 billion; (4) increased GM Financial finance income of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (5) unfavorable net foreign currency effect of $3.7 billion due to the weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. Dollar; (6) decreased revenues from powertrain and parts sales of $0.7 billion due to decreased volumes; (7) reduction in favorable lease residual adjustments of $0.5 billion; (8) decreased revenues from rental car leases of $0.2 billion; and (9) decreased revenues due to the deconsolidation of VM Motori (VMM) in June 2011 of $0.1 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2011 Total net sales and revenue increased by $14.7 billion (or 10.8%) due primarily to: (1) increased wholesale volumes of $8.6 billion representing 403,000 vehicles; (2) favorable net foreign currency effect of $2.6 billion due to the strengthening of certain currencies against the U.S. Dollar; (3) favorable vehicle pricing effect of $1.6 billion due to model year price increases and reduced sales allowances; (4) increased finance income of $1.1 billion due to the acquisition of GM Financial; (5) increased revenues from powertrain and parts sales of $1.1 billion due to increased volumes; (6) favorable vehicle mix of $0.6 billion; and (7) increased revenue of $0.4 billion due to the acquisition of GMS; partially offset by (8) decreased revenue of $1.0 billion due to the sale of Nexteer in November 2010.

As a result of the 363 Sale and other recent restructuring and cost savings initiatives, we have improved our financial position and level of operational flexibility as compared to Old GM when it operated the business. We commenced operations upon completion of the 363 Sale with a total amount of debt and other liabilities at July 10, 2009 that was $92.7 billion less than Old GM’s total amount of debt and other liabilities at July 9, 2009. We reached a competitive labor agreement with our unions, restructured our dealer network and reduced and refocused our brand strategy in the U.S. to our four brands. In November and December of 2010 we consummated a public offering of 550 million shares of our common stock and 100 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and listed both of these securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the common stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange. We are a leading global automotive company. Our vision is to design, build and sell the world’s best vehicles. We seek to distinguish our vehicles through superior design, quality, reliability, telematics (wireless voice and data) and infotainment and safety within their respective segments. Our business is diversified across products and geographic markets. With a global network of independent dealers we meet the local sales and service needs of our retail and fleet customers. Of our total 2010 vehicle sales volume, 73.6% was generated outside the United States, including 43.0% from emerging markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (collectively BRIC), which have recently experienced the industry’s highest volume growth.

In the year ended December 31, 2010 Total net sales and revenue increased by $31.0 billion (or 29.6%), primarily due to: (1) increased wholesale sales volume of $19.8 billion in GMNA due to an improving economy and recent vehicle launches; (2) increased wholesale volumes of $3.9 billion in GMIO due to an improving global economy and recent vehicle launches; (3) favorable vehicle pricing effect of $2.9 billion in GMNA due to lower sales allowances, partially offset by less favorable adjustments for U.S. residual support programs for leased vehicles; (4) increased wholesale volumes of $2.2 billion in GMSA driven by launches of the Chevrolet Cruze and Chevrolet Spark; (5) favorable vehicle mix of $1.6 billion due to increased crossover and truck sales in GMNA; (6) favorable net foreign currency translation effect of $1.0 billion, primarily due to the strengthening of major currencies in 2010 against the U.S. Dollar in GMSA; (7) increased sales of $1.0 billion due to the acquisition of Nexteer and four domestic component manufacturing facilities in GMNA; (8) favorable net foreign currency translation effect of $0.9 billion in GMIO; (9) favorable vehicle mix of $0.8 billion driven by the launch of the Chevrolet Cruze and increased sales of sports utility vehicles in GMIO; (10) favorable net foreign currency remeasurement effect of $0.8 billion in GMNA; (11) derivative losses of $0.8 billion in 2009, that did not recur in 2010, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar in GMIO; (12) favorable vehicle mix of $0.5 billion in GME; (13) favorable vehicle pricing effect of $0.5 billion driven by launches of the Opel Astra and Opel Meriva in GME; (14) favorable vehicle pricing effect of $0.3 billion primarily in Venezuela driven by the hyperinflationary economy in GMSA; (15) increased revenues from OnStar of $0.3 billion in GMNA; and (16) finance charge income of $0.3 billion due to the acquisition of AmeriCredit. These increases in Total net sales and revenue were partially offset by: (1) devaluation of the BsF in Venezuela of $0.9 billion in GMSA; (2) unfavorable net foreign currency translation effect of $0.7 billion in GME; (3) unfavorable vehicle mix of $0.4 billion in GMSA; and (4) decreased lease financing revenues of $0.3 billion related to the liquidation of the portfolio of automotive leases. In the year ended December 31, 2009 Total net sales and revenue decreased by $44.4 billion (or 29.8%) primarily due to: (1) decreased revenue of $36.7 billion in GMNA related to volume reductions; (2) decrease in domestic wholesale volumes and lower exports of $9.1 billion in GMIO; (3) decreased domestic wholesale volumes of $4.8 billion in GME; (4) unfavorable foreign currency translation effect and transaction losses of $3.7 billion in GME, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro; (5) decreased wholesale volumes of $2.2 billion in GMSA; (6) decreased revenue of $1.2 billion in GME related to Saab; unfavorable net foreign currency effect of $1.0 billion in GMIO; (8) decreased powertrain and parts and accessories revenue of $0.8 billion in GME; and (9) decreased lease financing revenue of $0.7 billion related to the continued liquidation of the portfolio of automotive retail leases. These decreases in Total net sales and revenue were partially offset by: (1) improved pricing, lower sales incentives and improved lease residuals of $5.4 billion in GMNA; (2) favorable vehicle mix of $2.8 billion in GMNA; (3) favorable vehicle pricing of $1.3 billion in GME; (4) decreased derivative losses of $0.9 billion in GMIO; (5) favorable pricing of $0.4 billion in GMSA, primarily due to a 60% price increase in Venezuela due to high inflation; and (6) favorable vehicle mix of $0.3 billion in GMIO driven by launches of new vehicle models at GM Daewoo.
.@0001467858.@GM.@2010-04-07.@Over time as Old GM’s market share declined in North America, Old GM needed to continually restructure its business operations to reduce cost and excess capacity. In addition, legacy labor costs and obligations and capacity in its dealer network made Old GM less competitive than new entrants into the U.S. market. These factors continue to strain on Old GM’s liquidity. In 2005 Old GM incurred significant losses from operations and from restructuring activities such as providing support to Delphi and other efforts intended to reduce operating costs. Old GM managed its liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives, capital markets transactions and sales of assets. However, the global credit market crisis had a dramatic effect on Old GM and the automotive industry. In the second half of 2008, the increased turmoil in the mortgage and overall credit markets (particularly the lack of financing for buyers or lessees of vehicles), the continued reductions in U.S. housing values, the volatility in the price of oil, recessions in the United States and Western Europe and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world created a substantially more difficult business environment. The ability to execute capital markets transactions or sales of assets was extremely limited, vehicle sales in North America and Western Europe contracted severely, and the pace of vehicle sales in the rest of the world slowed. Old GM’s liquidity position, as well as its operating performance, were negatively affected by these economic and industry conditions and by other financial and business factors, many of which were beyond its control. As a result of these economic conditions and the rapid decline in sales in the three months ended December 31, 2008 Old GM determined that, despite the actions it had then taken to restructure its U.S. business, it would be unable to pay its obligations in the normal course of business in 2009 or service its debt in a timely fashion, which required the development of a new plan that depended on financial assistance from the U.S. government. In December 2008 Old GM requested and received financial assistance from the U.S. government and entered into the UST Loan Agreement. In early 2009 Old GM’s business results and liquidity continued to deteriorate, and, as a result, Old GM obtained additional funding from the UST under the UST Loan Agreement. Old GM also received funding from EDC, a corporation wholly-owned by the government of Canada, under a loan and security agreement entered into in April 2009 (EDC Loan Facility). As a condition to obtaining the loans under the UST Loan Agreement, Old GM was required to submit a Viability Plan in February 2009 that included specific actions intended to result in the following: Repayment of all loans, interest and expenses under the UST Loan Agreement, and all other funding provided by the U.S. government; Compliance with federal fuel efficiency and emissions requirements and commencement of domestic manufacturing of advanced technology vehicles; Achievement of a positive net present value, using reasonable assumptions and taking into account all existing and projected future costs; Rationalization of costs, capitalization and capacity with respect to its manufacturing workforce, suppliers and dealerships; and a product mix and cost structure that is competitive in the U.S. marketplace. Management believes earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because it excludes amounts that management does not consider part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization. Management believes these measures allow it to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, benchmark performance among geographic regions and assess whether our plan to return to profitability is on target. Accordingly, we believe EBIT is useful in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. While management believes that EBIT provides useful information, it is not an operating measure under U. S. GAAP and there are limitations associated with its use. Our calculation of EBIT may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of EBIT has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other measures such as Net income (loss) or Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders. Due to these limitations, EBIT is used as a supplement to U. S. GAAP measures.
.@0001652044.@GOOGL.@2019-02-05.@Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business. As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization. As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in YouTube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional desktop search ads. Additionally, we continue to see a shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user, in the right moment, in the right context. Programmatic buying has a different monetization profile than traditional advertising buying on Google properties. Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile and other new formats. Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business. We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Accordingly, we expect TAC paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points. We expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins. As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins. Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. The margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business. A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile. As we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in R&D and capital expenditures. We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well as in new products and services. Our capital expenditures have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue in the long term as we invest heavily in data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure. In addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them. Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. Below are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (consolidated unless otherwise noted): Revenues of $136.8 billion and revenue growth of 23% year over year, constant currency revenue growth of 22% year over year. Google segment revenues of $136.2 billion with revenue growth of 23% year over year and Other Bets revenues of $595 million with revenue growth of 25% year over year. Revenues from the United States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $63.3 billion, $44.6 billion, $21.4 billion, and $7.6 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues was $59.5 billion, consisting of TAC of $26.7 billion and other cost of revenues of $32.8 billion. Our TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 23%. Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $50.9 billion. Income from operations was $26.3 billion. Other income (expense), net, was $8.6 billion. Effective tax rate was 12%. Net income was $30.7 billion with diluted net income per share of $43.70. Operating cash flow was $48.0 billion. Capital expenditures were $25.1 billion. Number of employees was 98,771 as of December 31, 2018. We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets. Google – Google includes our main products such as Ads, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Hardware (including Nest), Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Access as well as licensing and R&D services through Verily. In Q1 2018, Nest joined Google’s hardware team. Consequently, the financial results of Nest are reported in the Google segment, with Nest revenues reflected in Google other revenues. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation. Consolidated financial results are not affected.

In this multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. Our traffic acquisition cost (TAC) may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may differ from our traditional desktop and tablet formats. We expect both of these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 61,814 full-time employees: 23,336 in research and development, 19,082 in sales and marketing, 10,944 in operations, and 8,452 in general and administrative, an increase of 8,214 total headcount from December 31, 2014. Here are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (consolidated unless otherwise noted): Revenues of $75.0 billion and revenue growth of 14% year over year, constant currency revenue growth of 20% year over year.

Revenues from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Rest of World were $34.8 billion, $7.1 billion, and $33.1 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues was $28.2 billion, consisting of traffic acquisition costs of $14.4 billion and other cost of revenues of $13.8 billion. Our traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was 21%. Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $27.5 billion. Income from operations was $19.4 billion. Effective tax rate of 17%. Net income was $16.3 billion with diluted net income per share for Class A and B common stock of $22.84 and for Class C capital stock of $24.34. Operating cash flow was $26.0 billion. Capital expenditures were $9.9 billion. Headcount was 61,814 as of December 31, 2015. In conjunction with the Alphabet reorganization, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented legal and operational changes in how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) manages our businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Consequently, we have multiple operating segments, representing the individual businesses that are run separately under the Alphabet structure. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reportable segment change. Google – Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, Google Play as well as hardware products we sell, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. Our technical infrastructure and newer efforts like Virtual Reality are also included in Google.
.@0000039911.@GPS.@2019-03-19.@We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix, and Hill City brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are tailored uniquely across our portfolio of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 2, 2019, our operating segments included Old Navy Global, Gap Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment. On February 28, 2019, the Company announced plans to restructure the specialty fleet and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 Gap specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The Company believes these actions will drive a healthier specialty fleet and will serve as a more appropriate foundation for brand revitalization. During the two-year period, the Company estimates pre-tax costs associated with these closure actions to be about $250 million to $300 million, with the majority expected to be cash expenditures for lease-related costs. The remaining charges are expected to primarily include employee-related costs and the net impact of write-offs related to long-term assets and liabilities. The Company estimates an annualized sales loss of approximately $625 million as a result of these store closures, with resulting annualized pre-tax savings of about $90 million. On February 28, 2019, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into two independent publicly-traded companies: Old Navy and a yet-to-be-named company (“NewCo”), which will consist of Gap brand, Athleta, Banana Republic, Intermix, and Hill City. The separation is intended to enable both companies to capitalize on their respective opportunities and act decisively in an evolving retail environment by creating distinct financial profiles, tailored operating priorities and unique capital allocation strategies. Both companies will be positioned to create value for customers, shareholders and employees with enhanced focus and flexibility, aligned investments and incentives to meet the unique strategic goals, and optimized cost structures to deliver growth. The transaction is targeted to be completed in 2020 and is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, and the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard, Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, using the modified retrospective transition method and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings of $36 million, net of tax. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of this standard had a significant impact on the presentation of certain line items within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but did not have a material impact to operating income, net income or earnings per share for fiscal year 2018. The presentation changes primarily consist of $443 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 for revenue sharing associated with our credit card programs and breakage revenue for gift cards and credit vouchers, which now is recorded as net sales and previously was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income; and $176 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019, for reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our credit card programs, which now is recorded as net sales and previously was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures about the adoption of the new revenue standard. On August 29, 2016, a fire occurred in one of the buildings at a Company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York ("the Fishkill fire"). In January 2018, we agreed upon a final settlement with our insurers and all insurance proceeds were received as of February 3, 2018. Fiscal 2018 and 2016 consisted of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2017.

We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 3, 2018, our operating segments included Gap Global, Old Navy Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix.

Our aim is to capture additional market share in our home market, North America, where we have our largest structural advantages, and to focus on international regions with the greatest potential. As part of this effort, we closed the entire fleet of 53 Old Navy stores in Japan during fiscal 2016. Japan remains an important market for the Company's portfolio, with a continued strong presence of approximately 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores. Including the Old Navy closures in Japan, the Company closed 67 stores in total related to these measures in fiscal 2016. We also took steps toward creating a more efficient operating model, enabling us to more fully leverage our scale. For example, we centralized or consolidated several brand and corporate functions, allowing us to simplify the organization and operate more efficiently. In connection with the decision to close stores and streamline the Company's operations, the Company incurred $197 million in restructuring costs during fiscal 2016 on a pre-tax basis. The charges primarily include lease termination fees, employee-related costs, and store asset impairment. Certain of the costs incurred in foreign subsidiaries did not result in a tax benefit. Fiscal 2015 results were impacted by a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance in the future, including rightsizing the Gap brand store fleet primarily in North America, streamlining the brand's headquarter workforce, and developing a clear, on-brand product aesthetic framework to strengthen the Gap brand to compete more successfully on the global stage.

Following the fire, the Company immediately activated contingency plans to help mitigate the overall impact to the business. In October 2016, the Company completed construction of a temporary fulfillment site at the Fishkill campus, which was in place to process orders by peak holiday season, and plans to rebuild a permanent building are currently underway. For fiscal 2016, the Company incurred fire-related costs which included $86 million in inventory at cost, $12 million in property, plant, and equipment at net book value, and $35 million in other fire-related costs. In January of fiscal 2016, the Company agreed upon a partial settlement of $159 million related to the inventory and recorded a gain of $73 million, representing the excess over the loss on inventory. Based on the provisions of the Company’s insurance policies, the Company has determined that recovery of certain remaining fire-related costs incurred during fiscal 2016 is probable, and an insurance receivable, net of advance insurance proceeds received, has been recorded as of January 28, 2017 to offset the fire-related costs.

We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of January 31, 2015, the Company operated under a global brand structure for our major brands, Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. The Growth, Innovation, and Digital ("GID") division managed our newer brands, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix. As each of our operating segments (Gap Global, Old Navy Global, Banana Republic Global, and GID) share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment. In January 2015, we announced our decision to close the Piperlime brand. We expect to close the online platform and the store in New York by the end of the first half of fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2014, we successfully grew both revenue and earnings per share, while delivering progress against our strategic objectives. We continued to execute on our key initiatives, including global growth and omni-channel innovation. While we are pleased with the performance by Old Navy and encouraged by the improvement at Banana Republic, we remain focused on improving the assortment at Gap brand. In the face of challenging results at Gap brand, we demonstrated strong expense and inventory discipline across the Company. Additionally, we generated healthy free cash flow of $1.4 billion and cash flow from operating activities of $2.1 billion and continued our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, distributing $1.6 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Despite depreciating foreign currencies, which negatively impacted our operating results, our balanced approach of revenue growth combined with disciplined expense management and cash distribution drove earnings per share growth of 5 percent. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Net sales for fiscal 2014 increased 2 percent to $16.4 billion compared with $16.1 billion for fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our net sales increased 3 percent for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. See Net Sales discussion for impact of foreign exchange. Comparable sales for fiscal 2014 were flat compared with a 2 percent increase last year. Gross profit was $6.3 billion for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 38.3 percent compared with 39.0 percent for fiscal 2013. Operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 12.7 percent compared with 13.3 percent for fiscal 2013.

We also plan to continue our global growth, including opening additional stores in Asia with a focus on Gap China, Old Navy China, and Old Navy Japan. In addition, we also expect to open additional Athleta stores in the United States. In fiscal 2015, we expect that foreign exchange rate fluctuations will continue to have a meaningful negative impact on our results, particularly in our largest foreign subsidiaries in Canada and Japan. With the continuing depreciation of the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and other foreign currencies, we expect net sales translated into U.S. dollars will decrease and negatively impact our total Company net sales growth. In addition, we expect gross margins for our foreign subsidiaries to be negatively impacted as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars. In addition to the impact of the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we also expect that delayed merchandise receipts at the U.S. West Coast ports will have meaningful negative impact on our fiscal 2015 operating results.

We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Prior to fiscal 2013, we had two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. The Stores reportable segment included the results of the retail stores for Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. The Direct reportable segment included the results of our online brands, as well as Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we combined all channels and geographies under one global leader for each of the Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic brands. Each global brand president oversees their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. Our newer brands, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix, are managed by the president of our Growth, Innovation, and Digital ("GID") division, who oversees those brands' store and online operations. Each of our brands serves customers through its store and online channels. We have determined that each of our operating segments (Gap Global, Old Navy Global, Banana Republic Global, and GID) share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics and, effective February 3, 2013, we have aggregated the results of our operating segments into one reportable segment. We are pleased with our fiscal 2013 results. We continued to deliver against our priorities to grow sales with healthy merchandise margins, manage expenses in a disciplined manner, deliver operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth, and return excess cash to shareholders. We used a balanced approach to drive shareholder value even in the face of headwinds from foreign exchange and a shorter fiscal year calendar. We delivered positive comparable sales in each of the four quarters of fiscal 2013. We remained committed to our principle of returning excess cash to shareholders and distributed $1.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases. As we transitioned to a global brand structure to drive long-term global growth, we opened 190 Company-operated stores, primarily through expansion in Asia, growth of our global outlets, and Athleta stores in the United States. Specifically, we expanded our Gap store base in China, opening 34 stores for a total of 81 specialty and outlet stores, and opened an additional 17 Old Navy stores in Japan for a total of 18 stores. We opened 58 global outlets for a total of 532 outlet stores. We also opened 30 Athleta stores, ending fiscal 2013 with 65 Athleta stores. Our franchisees added 72 new stores and five new markets. Fiscal 2013 consisted of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2012. Net sales and operating results for fiscal 2013 reflect the impact of one less selling week as well as the calendar shift, which positively impacted the results of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and negatively impacted the results of the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, comparable ("Comp") sales for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014 are compared to the 52-week period ended February 2, 2013. Net sales for fiscal 2013 increased 3 percent to $16.1 billion compared with $15.7 billion for fiscal 2012. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our net sales increased 5 percent for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012. See Net Sales discussion for impact of foreign exchange. Online sales for fiscal 2013 increased 21 percent to $2.3 billion compared with $1.9 billion for fiscal 2012 and grew 2 percentage points, as a percentage of total net sales, to 14 percent compared with 12 percent for fiscal 2012. Comparable sales for fiscal 2013 increased 2 percent compared with a 5 percent increase last year. Gross profit for fiscal 2013 was $6.3 billion compared with $6.2 billion for fiscal 2012.

Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of net sales. Net income for fiscal 2013 was $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal 2012.

In addition to increasing sales within our existing business, we also plan to grow revenues through our newer brands, channels, and geographies, including the following: growing global online sales, driven by continued investments in our omni-channel capabilities; opening additional stores in Asia with a focus on Gap China, Old Navy China, and Old Navy Japan; expanding our global outlet presence; opening additional Athleta stores; and continuing to expand our franchise presence worldwide. In fiscal 2014, we expect foreign exchange rate fluctuations to have a meaningful negative impact on the results of our largest foreign subsidiaries in Canada and Japan. With the continuing depreciation of the Canadian dollar and Japanese yen, we expect net sales in Canadian dollars and Japanese yen translated into U.S. dollars will decrease and negatively impact our total Company net sales growth. In addition, we expect gross margins for our largest foreign subsidiaries to be negatively impacted as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over 80 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands. We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. As of February 2, 2013, we have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. We are pleased with our fiscal 2012 results. We delivered against our stated priorities to drive increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently invest in our business, grow earnings per share, and return excess cash to shareholders. We delivered positive comparable sales in North America for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy in each of the four quarters of fiscal 2012. We executed on key expansion initiatives with 25 new Athleta stores, more than 30 new Gap stores in China, and our first Old Navy store in Japan. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow and distributed $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 and 2010. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week. Financial results for fiscal 2012 are as follows: Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $1.1 billion to $15.7 billion compared with $14.5 billion for fiscal 2011. Comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, for fiscal 2012 increased 5 percent compared with a 4 percent decrease last year. Direct net sales for fiscal 2012 increased by 24 percent to $1.9 billion compared with $1.6 billion for fiscal 2011. Gross profit for fiscal 2012 was $6.2 billion compared with $5.3 billion for fiscal 2011. Gross margin for fiscal 2012 was 39.4 percent compared with 36.2 percent for fiscal 2011. Operating expenses for fiscal 2012 increased $393 million to $4.2 billion compared with $3.8 billion for fiscal 2011 and increased 0.6 percent as a percentage of net sales. Operating margin for fiscal 2012 was 12.4 percent compared with 9.9 percent for fiscal 2011. Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of net sales. Net income for fiscal 2012 was $1.1 billion compared with $833 million for fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share increased 49 percent to $2.33 for fiscal 2012 compared with $1.56 for fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion compared with free cash flow of $815 million for fiscal 2011.  During fiscal 2012, we repurchased about 34 million shares for $1.0 billion and paid cash dividends of $240 million. In October 2012, we announced a new global brand structure that will guide our long-term growth strategies and shape our future management structure. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. Each global brand president will oversee their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. Our newer brands (Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix) will be managed within our new Growth, Innovation, and Digital division as part of the new structure. Our business and financial priorities for fiscal 2013 are as follows: grow sales with healthy merchandise margins; manage our expenses in a disciplined manner; deliver operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth; and return excess cash to shareholders. In addition to increasing sales within our existing business, we also plan to grow revenues through our new brands, channels, and geographies, including the following: opening additional stores in Asia with a focus on Gap China and Old Navy Japan; expanding our global outlet presence; continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and opening additional Athleta stores. In fiscal 2013, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60.

We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Fiscal 2011 was a challenging year. Unemployment remained high in our core North America markets and the apparel retail environment was quite promotional. The debt crisis in Europe increased stock market volatility globally, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan had a negative impact on our business in Asia. Our largest expense, cost of goods sold, escalated sharply in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of global cotton price inflation, putting significant pressure on our margins, especially in the second half of fiscal 2011. Finally, we had product challenges throughout fiscal 2011 in our domestic and international businesses. As a result, earnings for fiscal 2011 were below last year. Despite these challenges, we are pleased with the progress we made against our long-term strategic plan, including growing our online business and expanding internationally. We also continued to reduce our square footage in North America through closures and consolidations at Gap and downsizes at Old Navy. We managed our operating expenses carefully. We delivered higher average selling price per unit throughout the year, enabled by our disciplined inventory management.

As we focus on growing revenues in our more mature North America market in fiscal 2011, we plan to continue growing revenues internationally through the following: opening additional stores, many of which will be outlets, in Canada, Europe, and Asia; continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and continuing to offer our online shopping experience to customers in international locations. Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, wholesale and franchise revenues, and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment. The percentage change in comparable store (“Comp”) sales by brand and region and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows: Only the Company-operated stores are included in the calculation of Comp sales. The Comp sales calculation excludes sales from our online and catalog businesses and wholesale and franchise businesses. Gap and Banana Republic outlet Comp sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. A store is included in Comp when it has been open for at least 12 months and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison. A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open for less than 12 months or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year. Beginning in fiscal 2011, the Company reports comparable sales including the associated comparable online sales. Online comparable sales are defined as sales through online channels in regions where we have existing comparable store sales. The Company’s comparable sales including the associated comparable online sales increased 2 percent for fiscal 2010.

In September 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Athleta, Inc. (“Athleta”), a women’s sports and active apparel company based in Petaluma, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $148 million. The acquisition will allow us to enhance our presence in the growing women’s active apparel sector in the United States. We believe this acquisition complements our brands and allows us to leverage our online platform to expand into this significant retail sector. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 had 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2006. Net sales numbers for the fourth quarter and year for fiscal 2006 include this additional week; however, comparable store sales calculations exclude the 53rd week.

We repurchased approximately 46 million shares of our common stock for a total of $745 million under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008. We also declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.34 per share in fiscal 2008. We opened 101 new stores and closed 119 stores in fiscal 2008. Macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and continued in the fourth quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were down 13 percent from the prior year comparable period. Despite this, our cash flow generation remains healthy and we have a strong balance sheet. As of January 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.8 billion and long-term debt of $50 million, classified as current, was repaid in March 2009. We believe our cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future. During this challenging economic environment we are focused on the following priorities: consistently delivering product that aligns with our target customers; improving customer experience and continuing to invest in the store fleet in a manner that supports improvement in return on invested capital; managing inventory to support a healthy merchandise margin; maintaining a focus on cost management; and generating strong free cash flow.

Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 increased 7 percent to $867 million, or $1.09 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $809 million, or $0.97 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2006. In February 2007, we announced our decision to close our Forth & Towne store locations. We eliminated about 550 Forth & Towne positions and closed all 19 stores by the end of June 2007. Forth & Towne is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We recorded a loss from the discontinued operation of $34 million, net of income tax benefit, in fiscal 2007 and we expect future charges to be immaterial. As part of our efforts to streamline operations, we examined our organizational structure to ensure that we were enabling our brands to make decisions and effect change more efficiently. These cost reduction initiatives resulted in $34 million of expenses in fiscal 2007, of which $32 million were operating expenses and $2 million were cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses. The majority of these expenses were related to severance benefits for employees at our headquarter locations. Net earnings for fiscal 2007 were $833 million, or $1.05 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $778 million, or $0.93 per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2006. Included in net earnings for fiscal 2007 was $68 million, or $0.07 per share on a diluted basis, related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne and expenses associated with our cost reduction initiatives described above. Our online sales for fiscal 2007 increased 24 percent to $903 million, compared with $730 million for fiscal 2006. We generated cash flows from operating activities of $2.1 billion during 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we paid $326 million related to the maturity of our 6.90 percent notes payable. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 were $682 million. In fiscal 2007, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion compared with free cash flow of $678 million in fiscal 2006. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less the purchase of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure, see the Financial Condition section in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We repurchased about 89 million shares of our common stock for a total of $1.7 billion under our share repurchase programs in fiscal 2007 which underscores our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2007, we focused on three critical areas to restore the health of the Company: simplifying the business and holding each brand accountable to its priorities, managing our inventory with discipline to enable growth in gross margin and gross profit, and focusing on product and target customers, specifically at Gap and Old Navy. This work helped us increase net earnings and has created the important groundwork for our future. In fiscal 2008, we will focus on four priorities: driving earnings through inventory discipline which supports improved gross margin, continuing cost management, improving return on invested capital, and continuing to focus on product across all brands. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In February 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for our share repurchase program and a plan to increase the annual dividend per share by six percent, from $0.32 per share in fiscal 2007 to $0.34 per share in fiscal 2008.

.@0000039911.@GPS.@2007-04-02.@Fiscal 2006 was a challenging year for us. Net sales were $15.9 billion compared with $16.0 billion last year, traffic was weak and comparable store sales decreased by 7 percent compared with a decrease of 5 percent last year. While we saw progress at Banana Republic where customers responded well to our improved product assortments, product acceptance at Gap and Old Navy brands continued to be a challenge. As a result, additional promotions and markdowns drove a 4 percent decrease in gross profit from $5.9 billion in fiscal 2005 to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Piperlime.com was launched successfully in the third quarter and we opened franchised stores in the Middle East and Asia. We invested in marketing and stores in an effort to turnaround our business performance which contributed to a 9 percent increase in operating expenses from $4.1 billion in fiscal 2005 to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2006. Combined, these factors contributed to a 25 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share of $0.93 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2007 compared with $1.24 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006. Despite these disappointing results, we generated free cash flow of $678 million defined as the net cash provided by operating activities less the purchase of property and equipment (for a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, to a GAAP measure, see the Liquidity section in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis). We utilized our excess cash to repurchase $1 billion of common stock, and increased our annual dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.32 per share for a total of $265 million. In 2007, we are focusing on three priorities: fixing our core business by creating the right product and store experience, retaining and developing the best talent in the industry, and examining our organization structure to ensure that we enable our brands to make decisions and effect change more efficiently. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and maintaining sufficient cash on the balance sheet to support the needs of our business and to withstand unanticipated business volatility. Since January 2007, we have taken the following actions: Leadership changes. Our Board of Directors announced a change in the chief executive officer position. Mr. Robert Fisher, our current non-employee chairman of the board of directors, stepped in to serve as interim president and chief executive officer. In addition, we announced Marka Hansen, former president of Banana Republic, as the new president of the Gap Brand and Michael Cape, former Vice President, Director of Brand Marketing for J.C. Penney Company, Inc., as the new executive vice president of marketing for the Old Navy brand. Conversion of Old Navy’s Outlet stores into Old Navy stores. In order to drive improved returns and leverage its existing retail channel, we made the decision in February 2007 to convert 45 Old Navy Outlet stores into Old Navy stores. We expect the conversion to be completed by October 2007. Closure of distribution facility. As part of our on-going assessment of network capacity, we made the decision in February 2007 to close a distribution facility in Hebron, Kentucky. The expenses associated with converting the Old Navy Outlet stores and closing the distribution center are expected to be approximately $6 million in fiscal 2007. Closure of Forth & Towne. After a thorough analysis revealed that the concept was not demonstrating enough potential to deliver acceptable long-term return on investment, we announced in February 2007 that we would close our Forth & Towne stores. We plan to close all 19 stores by the end of June 2007 and expect the pre-tax expenses associated with the closure to be approximately $40 million. Net sales consist of retail sales, online sales and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. Fiscal 2006 had 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net sales numbers for the quarter and year include this additional week; however, comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Net sales for the 53rd week of fiscal 2006 were $200 million.
 .@0000773840.@HON.@2019-02-08.@During 2018, Honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. We grew net sales 3% to $41,802 million and grew income before taxes 8% to $7,487 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We have continued our focus on commercial excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (“VPD”), to drive higher sales at better margins. We are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies. Our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. In 2018 we deployed capital of $7.6 billion, including the following: we invested over $0.8 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects. In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 10%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings. The dividend increase in September 2018 marked the ninth consecutive double-digit increase since 2010. we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share count flat and by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2018, we repurchased 26.5 million shares for $4.0 billion. we deployed approximately $0.5 billion during 2018 on acquisitions. A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The foreign currency translation impact in 2018 compared with 2017 was principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat. The strengthening of the Euro was offset by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of products and services sold increased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $790 million (driven by higher sales volume and inflation partially offset by divestitures and productivity) and higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $70 million. Gross margin percentage decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact) partially offset by higher gross margin in the segments (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact collectively). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $220 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $90 million, partially offset by decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million and lower labor costs of approximately $60 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage point impact collectively), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact) and by lower gross margin in Home and Building Solutions and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively). Aerospace sales increased due to organic sales growth, due to both volume and price, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard (included within Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net in the table above), offset by the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business on October 1, 2018. Commercial Original Equipment sales increased 14% (increased 11% organic) primarily due to increased demand from business aviation, and air transport and regional original equipment manufacturers (OEM), lower OEM incentives and the impact from the classification of nonrecurring engineering and development funding resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 5% (increased 5% organic) primarily due to growth in business aviation and air transport and regional. Defense and Space sales increased 15% (increased 15% organic) primarily driven by growth in U.S. and international defense. Transportation Systems sales decreased 17% driven by divestiture impacts following its October 1, 2018 spin-off. For the nine-month period prior to the spin-off, sales increased 7% organic driven by higher volumes in light vehicle gas turbos and commercial vehicles. Aerospace segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, and the impact on service programs from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, partially offset by the Transportation Systems divestiture. The increase in operational segment profit was driven primarily by higher organic sales volume, price, productivity net of inflation, and lower OEM incentives, partially offset by the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher organic sales volume, the impact of foreign currency translation and inflation, partially offset by the Transportation Systems divestiture. Aerospace sales were flat due to organic sales growth, offset by the government services business divestiture. Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased 2% (decreased 2% organic) primarily due to lower shipments to business jet OEMs, partially offset by lower air transport and regional OEM incentives. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 6% (increased 6% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments. Defense and Space sales decreased 7% (increased 1% organic) primarily due to the government services business divestiture and lower Space sales, partially offset by growth in U.S. defense. Transportation Systems sales increased 3% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher commercial vehicle volumes, gas turbo penetration and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by lower diesel turbo volumes. Aerospace segment profit increased due to an increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by the government services business divestiture. The increase in operational segment profit was driven primarily by productivity, net of inflation, including restructuring benefits, lower OEM incentives and higher organic sales volume, partially offset by the government services business divestiture. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily driven by the government services business divestiture and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by higher organic sales volume.

Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2017, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $2.9 billion. In 2017, we paid cash dividends of $2.1 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 12%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings. Since 2010, we have increased the dividend rate by 10% or more eight times. we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects. A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this MD&A. The foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat. The strengthening of the Euro was offset by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation impact in 2016 compared with 2015 is principally driven by the weakening of the British Pound, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $260 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $90 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income, and lower pension mark-to-market expense, allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately $110 million, and decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage point impact collectively) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income and lower pension market to market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.6 percentage point impact) and by lower gross margin in Home and Building Solutions and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $380 million (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity, net of inflation, and foreign currency translation), higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately $135 million and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of $70 million, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold of $200 million.

.@0000773840.@HON.@2017-02-10.@In 2016, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic environment. We grew net sales 2% to $39,302 million, grew earnings per share of common stock – assuming dilution 3% to $6.20 and grew net income attributable to Honeywell 1% to $4,809 million. We executed on cost reduction activities, accelerated our capital deployment strategy and improved the growth portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, including the divestiture of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. and the tax-free spin-off of AdvanSix. We also announced the realignment of the business units comprising our Automation and Control Solutions segment to two new reportable operating segments, as previously mentioned. The Company also announced a leadership succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer and successfully executed leadership transitions in three of our four reportable operating segments. We continued our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value without sacrificing growth investment, including maintaining R&D spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization, over $300 million of new repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. We also continued to enhance our software capabilities through the creation of a software center in the United States to staff more than 730 full-time product software engineers, who are in addition to the more than 11,000 software engineers already part of Honeywell. In 2016 we deployed capital of over $7.5 billion, including the following: we deployed over $2.5 billion during 2016, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our four operating segments. These acquisitions all share a software and technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization. after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2015, we increased our annual dividend rate by 12% in 2016, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend faster than earnings, marking the 12th dividend increase in the past 11 years. we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. In 2016, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $2.1 billion. we invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return investments such as the expansion of facilities to manufacture our Solstice® low global-warming potential refrigerant products and building new production facilities to make UOP catalyst and absorbent products. Honeywell also completed refinancing of long-term debt through the issuance of €4,000 million Senior Notes in February and an additional $4,500 million Senior Notes in October. The proceeds from the offerings of Senior Notes were used to repurchase $2,200 million of Senior Notes outstanding, as well as repay outstanding commercial paper. We expect these refinancing activities will reduce our ongoing annual interest expense. Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to higher incentives to original equipment manufacturers (OEM Incentives), a decrease in organic sales volumes and the Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. divestiture, which was partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 13% (decreased 12% organic) primarily due to higher OEM incentives and decreased demand from business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), partially offset by higher shipments to air transport OEMs. Consistent with broader aerospace industry trends, we expect the continuation of lower business and general aviation OEM sales volumes. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% (increased 3% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments. Defense and Space sales decreased by 7% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to declines in U.S. space and international defense programs, lower U.S. government services revenue, largely attributable to the impact of divestitures, and decreased demand from commercial helicopter OEMs, partially offset by sales from acquisitions. Transportation Systems sales increased by 3% (increased 4% organic) primarily driven by new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. Aerospace segment profit decreased primarily due to a 6% decrease in operational segment profit and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in OEM incentives predominantly to air transport and regional aviation OEMs. Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 11% (increased by 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in OEM Incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers. Defense and Space sales decreased by 1% (flat organic) primarily due to lower U.S. government revenue, partially offset by growth in international programs. Transportation Systems sales decreased by 19% (increased 3% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit and a 6% favorable impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly the absence of higher prior year OEM Incentives), as discussed above, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily driven by productivity, net of inflation, and favorable pricing, partially offset by continued investments for growth.

.@0000773840.@HON.@2016-02-12.@In 2015, Honeywell successfully navigated a challenging macro-economic climate by combining strategic growth in our diverse portfolio and our well-known cost discipline with a marked acceleration of our capital deployment strategy. Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution, grew 13% to $6.04 per share in 2015 and net income attributable to Honeywell grew 12% to $4,768 million. Our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion of 220 basis points versus 2014 without sacrificing seed planting intended to ensure future growth, including maintaining R&D spending at 5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety and security and productivity, $216 million of repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth Regions. Honeywell Operating System (HOS) Gold and Honeywell User Experience (HUE) initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity through sustainable improvements to our factories, footprints and supply chain. In 2015 we deployed capital of over $10 billion, including the following: Mergers and Acquisitions—we deployed over $5 billion during 2015, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our three operating segments. These acquisitions all share a technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization and customer productivity. Dividend—after a 15% dividend rate increase in 2014, we again increased our annual dividend rate by 15% in 2015, as we seek to grow the dividend faster than earnings. Share Repurchases—we continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans. In 2015, we repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.9 billion. Capital Investment in Facilities—we invested over $1 billion in high return capital expenditures, focused on revenue growth projects such as our Solstice low global-warming potential refrigerant products for the automotive industry and catalyst products in UOP.

.@0000773840.@HON.@2015-02-13.@For Honeywell, 2014 represented a year of strong performance despite a continued slow growth global environment. Honeywell’s 2014 revenues were $40.3 billion representing a 3% improvement compared to 2013 revenues of $39.1 billion. Our segment profit improved by 5%, more than one and one-half times revenue growth, evidencing the Company’s continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on effective repositioning. The Company’s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes, the Honeywell Enablers, which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. We continued to execute on our key strategies for growth including penetration of high growth regions and investments in high return capital expenditures and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost disciplines and leveraging the Honeywell Enablers. The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: R&D spending at 4.7% of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, avionics equipment and technology, connected voice and wireless control devices and technologies, software and mobile app development and data science to deliver value. Capital expenditures of $1,094 million (in addition to $947 million in 2013) principally related to the construction and expansion of Aerospace and PMT manufacturing facilities, as well as continued investment in our ACS facilities. The Company recognized $184 million of charges relating to repositioning actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses to ensure they fit our long-term strategic plan. In 2014, the Company sold its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. In addition, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Datamax-O’Neil, a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers, for $185 million (the transaction is expected to close in early 2015). Expansion of Honeywell’s presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Sales to customers outside the United States increased by 5% in 2014 and now account for approximately 55% of total revenues. Operating cash flow grew by 16% in 2014 to $5,024 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $1,094 million in capital expenditures, repay $600 million in long-term debt, provide a 15% increase in the Company’s cash dividend rate (vs. 2013) and repurchase 10.0 million shares of common stock. Aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture and an increase in incentive payments due to air transport and regional and business and general aviation original equipment (OE) manufacturers (OEM Incentive Payments), partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below. Commercial Original Equipment sales decreased by 2% (increased by 3% organic) primarily due to an increase in OEM Incentive Payments to air transport and regional OE manufacturers, partially offset by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers’ higher production rates, and business and general aviation engine shipments. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher sales of spare parts to air transport and regional customers, partially offset by a decline in retrofits, modifications and upgrades and lower repair and overhaul activities for our business and general aviation customers. Defense and Space sales decreased by 2% primarily due to lower U.S. government services revenue and the absence of a prior year royalty gain, partially offset by growth in international programs. Transportation Systems sales decreased by 3% (increased by 5% organic) primarily due to the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches, higher global turbo gas penetration and increased commercial vehicle demand in Europe. Aerospace segment profit increased by 2% due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly higher OEM Incentive Payments and the absence of a prior year royalty gain), as discussed above. The increase in operational segment profit is driven primarily by favorable price and productivity, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold totaled $11.7 billion in 2014, a decrease of $190 million, primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price). Aerospace sales increased primarily due to favorable pricing, increased volumes in our Commercial Original Equipment business and increased licensing revenue (primarily due to a royalty gain in the fourth quarter), offset by decreased volumes in our Defense and Space and Commercial Aftermarket businesses and an increase in incentive payments due to business and general aviation and air transport and regional OE manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms. Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers’ higher production rates, and strong demand in the business jet mid to large cabin segment, partially offset by an increase in OEM Incentive Payments to business and general aviation customers. Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% driven primarily by higher retrofits, modifications and upgrades activities and higher repair and overhaul activities for air transport and regional customers, partially offset by fewer repair and overhaul activities for business and general aviation customers. Defense and Space sales decreased by 5% primarily due to U.S. government program ramp downs and lower defense budget, partially offset by a royalty gain in the fourth quarter. Transportation Systems sales increased by 5% primarily due to an increase in organic sales driven by continued strong growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration. Aerospace segment profit increased by 6% primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth, as discussed above, including favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by lower defense and space sales, as discussed above.

Despite a modest 2.5 percent growth in World GDP and Industrial Production, Honeywell’s 2013 revenues were $39.1 billion representing a 4 percent improvement compared to 2012 revenues of $37.7 billion. Our segment profit improved by 8 percent, roughly two times revenue growth, evidencing the Company’s continued focus on operational excellence. We achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on proactive repositioning. See Review of Business Segments section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes. The Company’s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. Honeywell refers to these processes as the Honeywell Enablers. In 2013, Honeywell continued to strengthen and expand the use of the Honeywell Enablers: The Honeywell Operating System (“HOS”): HOS drives sustainable improvements in our manufacturing operations to generate exceptional performance in safety, quality, delivery, cost, and inventory management. Approximately 75 percent of our manufacturing cost base has achieved HOS certification. Velocity Product Development (“VPD”): VPD is a process which brings together all of the functions necessary to successfully launch new products—R&D, manufacturing, marketing and sales—to increase the probability that in commercializing new technologies Honeywell delivers the right products at the right price. Functional Transformation (“FT”): Functional Transformation is HOS for our administrative functions—Finance, Legal, HR, IT and Purchasing—standardizing the way we work, which improves service quality and reduces costs. The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: R&D spending at 4.6 percent of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, and voice control and wireless control devices and technologies. Capital expenditures grew 7 percent to $947 million principally related to the construction and expansion of Performance Materials and Technologies manufacturing facilities, as well as upgrades to our Aerospace facilities. The Company recognized approximately $231 million of charges relating to restructuring actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. The Company completed $1,133 million (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions in 2013, including the acquisition of Intermec, Inc. (“Intermec”), a leading provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions (RFID) and bar code, label and receipt printers for use in warehousing, supply chain, field service and manufacturing environments and RAE Systems, Inc. (RAE), a global manufacturer of fixed and portable gas and radiation detection systems, and software. The Company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses and to divest those that do not fit within our long-term strategic plan. In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Friction Materials business for approximately $155 million. Expansion of Honeywell’s presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and Latin America. Sales to customers outside the United States now account for approximately 55 percent of total revenues. Operating cash flow grew by 23 percent in 2013 to $4,335 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $947 million in capital expenditures, partially fund the acquisitions discussed above, make $156 million in non-U.S. pension contributions, provide a 10 percent increase in the Company’s cash dividend rate (vs. 2012) and repurchase 13.5 million shares of common stock. Aerospace sales were flat in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to favorable pricing, increased volumes in our commercial original equipment (OE) business and increased licensing revenue (primarily due to a royalty gain in the fourth quarter), offset by decreased volumes in our defense and space and commercial aftermarket businesses and an increase in payments due to business and general aviation and air transport and regional OE manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms (OEM Payments). Details regarding the changes in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Commercial original equipment (OE) sales increased by 3 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. Air transport and regional OE sales increased by 7 percent in 2013 driven by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the OE Manufacturers’ (OEM) higher production rates, partially offset by lower regional jet sales. Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 3 percent in 2013 driven by an increase in OEM Payments to business and general aviation customers, partially offset by strong demand in the business jet mid to large cabin segment. Commercial aftermarket sales increased by 2 percent in 2013 compared to 2012. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales were flat for 2013 primarily due to higher repair and overhaul activities related to utilization, offset by lower spares volumes. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2013 primarily due to higher sales for retrofit, modifications and upgrades, partially offset by fewer repair and overhaul activities. Defense and space sales decreased by 5 percent in 2013 primarily due to U.S. government program ramp downs and lower defense budget, partially offset by a royalty gain in the fourth quarter. Aerospace segment profit increased by 4 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth, as discussed above, including favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by lower defense and space sales, as discussed above. The segment margin impact from other factors was flat, which reflects the net effect of a royalty gain in the fourth quarter, offset by the unfavorable impact from an increase in OEM Payments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $8.8 billion in 2013, a decrease of approximately $101 million from 2012 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price). Aerospace sales increased by 5 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 3 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume, a 1 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures, and a 1 percent increase in revenue related to an $88 million reduction in payments to business and general aviation OE manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms (OEM Payments). Details regarding the changes in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Commercial original equipment (OE) sales increased by 19 percent (12 percent organic) in 2012 compared to 2011. Air transport and regional OE sales increased by 11 percent (11 percent organic) in 2012 primarily driven by higher sales to our OE customers, consistent with higher production rates, and a favorable platform mix. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 34 percent (15 percent organic) in 2012 driven by strong demand in the business jet end-market, favorable platform mix, growth from acquisitions and the favorable 12 percent impact of the OEM Payments discussed above. Commercial aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2012 compared to 2011. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent for 2012 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and higher maintenance activity driven by an approximate 2 percent increase in global flying hours in 2012, increased sales of avionics upgrades, and changes in customer buying patterns relating to maintenance activity in the first half of 2012. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 17 percent in 2012 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and revenue associated with maintenance service agreements and a higher penetration in retrofit, modifications, and upgrades. Defense and space sales decreased by 3 percent (negative 4 percent organic) in 2012 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs, partially offset by higher international aftermarket sales and growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aerospace segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 8 percent, a 4 percent favorable impact from lower OEM Payments, discussed above, and a 1 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures. The increase in operational segment profit is due to the favorable impact from higher price and productivity, net of inflation, and commercial demand partially offset by increased research, development and engineering investments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $9.0 billion in 2012, an increase of approximately $324 million from 2011 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price).
.@0000773840.@HON.@2013-02-15.@For Honeywell, 2012 marked another year of strong growth despite a challenging political and macro-economic environment. The Company continued to manage uncertainty associated with slower than expected economic growth in the United States, recession in the European Union, political unrest in the Middle East, and slowing growth in China and other emerging economies. Despite a modest 2.6 percent growth in World GDP and Industrial Production, Honeywell’s 2012 revenues were $37.7 billion representing a 3 percent improvement compared to 2011 revenues of $36.5 billion. Honeywell’s 2012 revenue growth was achieved despite significant foreign exchange weakness in the Euro and other non-U.S. dollar currencies which had a negative 2 percent impact on our 2012 revenues. Our segment profit improved by 10 percent, in excess of three times revenue growth, evidencing the Company’s continued focus on operational excellence. See Review of Business Segments section of this MD&A for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes. The Company’s operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes which drive efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers.

Functional Transformation (“FT”): Functional Transformation is HOS for our administrative functions—Finance, Legal, HR, IT and Purchasing—standardizing the way we work, which improves service quality and reduces costs. Organizational Efficiency (“OEF”): OEF is, in its simplest form, the cost of labor. Improvements in OEF represent the success of Honeywell’s initiatives to increase labor cost efficiency and employee productivity. The Company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics: R&D spending at 4.9 percent of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, and wireless control devices and technologies. Capital expenditures grew 11 percent to $884 million including the construction or expansion of technology centers in India and Saudi Arabia. The Company recognized approximately $119 million of restructuring actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come. The Company completed $438 million (net of cash acquired) in acquisitions in 2012, including acquisition of a 70 percent ownership interest in Thomas Russell L.L.C. (“Thomas Russell Co.”), a leader in technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating, primarily serving the US market. Expansion of Honeywell’s presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle-East, and Latin America. Sales to customers outside the United States now account for approximately 55 percent of total revenues. Operating cash flow grew by 24 percent in 2012 to $3,517 million. This operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $884 million in capital expenditures, fund the acquisitions discussed above, make $1,039 million in pension contributions, and provide an 11 percent increase in dividends paid (vs. 2011) and repurchase 5 million shares of common stock. Aerospace is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, avionics, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors.

Defense and space sales decreased by 3 percent (negative 4 percent organic) in 2012 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs, partially offset by higher international aftermarket sales and growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aerospace segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 8 percent, a 4 percent favorable impact from lower OEM payments, discussed above, and a 1 percent increase from acquisitions, net of divestitures. The increase in operational segment profit is due to the favorable impact from higher price and productivity, net of inflation, and commercial demand partially offset by increased research, development and engineering investments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $9.0 billion in 2012, an increase of approximately $324 million from 2011 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price). Aerospace sales increased by 7 percent in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in organic growth of 7 percent primarily due to increased commercial sales volume. Details regarding the increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Commercial OE sales increased by 15 percent (11 percent organic) in 2011 compared with 2010. Air transport and regional OE sales increased by 6 percent in 2011 primarily driven by higher sales to our OE customers, consistent with higher production rates, platform mix and a higher win rate on selectables (components selected by purchasers of new aircraft). Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 41 percent (24 percent organic) in 2011 due to a rebound from near trough levels in 2010 and strong demand in the business jet end market, favorable platform mix, growth from acquisitions and lower OEM Payments during 2011. Commercial aftermarket sales increased by 18 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 16 percent in 2011 primarily due to (i) increased maintenance activity and spare parts sales driven by an approximately 6 percent increase in global flying hours, (ii) increased sales of avionics upgrades, and (iii) changes in customer buying patterns relating to spare parts and maintenance activity. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 24 percent in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of spare parts and revenue associated with maintenance service agreements. Defense and space sales decreased by 2 percent (negative 3 percent organic) in 2011 primarily due to anticipated program ramp downs, partially offset by higher domestic and international aftermarket sales, increased unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shipments and the EMS acquisition (refer to Note 2). Aerospace segment profit increased by 10 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit of 9 percent and an increase of 1 percent due to lower OEM Payments made during 2011. The increase in operational segment profit is comprised of the positive impact from higher commercial aftermarket demand, price and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by research, development and engineering investments. Cost of products and services sold totaled $8.7 billion in 2011, an increase of approximately $566 million from 2010 which is primarily a result of the factors discussed above (excluding price).

Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reductions initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decreases in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009. Defense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices.
.@0000773840.@HON.@2010-02-12.@This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell and its four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including their respective areas of focus for 2010 and the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and a discussion of each segment’s results for the three years ended December 31, 2009. Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 23 to the financial statements for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. Cost of products and services sold decreased by $4,809 million or 17 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MD&A, lower material costs, reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work scheduled reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of indirect cost savings initiatives across each of our Business Segments and lower repositioning charges. Gross margin increased by 1.6 percent in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increases of 2.9 and 0.6 percent, respectively in our Specialty Materials and Automation & Controls Solutions segments, as a result of the cost savings initiatives discussed above and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by lower margins in our Transportation Systems and Aerospace Solutions segments of 3.2 and 0.7 percent, respectively, due to lower sales partially offset by the impact of cost savings initiatives. Cost of products and services sold increased by $1,694 million or 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher sales as a result of the factors discussed within the Review of Business Segments section of this MD&A, acquisitions and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense. Gross margin decreased by 0.6 of a percentage point in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to (i) higher repositioning charges and (ii) decreases of 2.2 and 1.4 percent, respectively, in our Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials segments, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by (i) lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense, (ii) higher margins in our Automation and Controls Solutions segment of 0.8 of a percentage point mainly resulting from productivity savings, and (iii) higher margins in our Aerospace segment of 0.2 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth and increased prices. Aerospace sales decreased by 15 percent in 2009. Details regarding the decrease in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 21 percent in 2009. The decrease is driven by lower sales to our OE customers, consistent with production rates and platform mix, and the impact of divesting our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by a 12 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly due to the absence of a strike at a major OEM in the fourth quarter of 2008. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales decreased by 16 percent in 2009 primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower maintenance activity driven by the impact of higher parked aircraft part utilization, customer inventory reduction initiatives and decreased flying hours of approximately 2 percent, including a 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter. While we expect global flying hours to increase slightly in 2010, we expect aftermarket sales to remain soft in the first half of 2010 due to the continuation of inventory destocking and the rising number of parked aircraft. Business and general aviation OE sales decreased by 51 percent in 2009 due to the decrease in new business jet deliveries reflecting rescheduling and cancellations of deliveries by OE customers. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales decreased by 27 percent in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of spare parts and lower revenue associated with maintenance service agreements, consistent with the decrease in business jet utilization. We started to see an increase in business jet utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009 and expect stabilization at these levels. Defense and space sales were essentially unchanged in 2009, primarily due to higher sales of logistics services and original equipment for military platforms in the first nine months of 2009 offset by program completions. Delays in defense and space programs could impact the timing of sales in this end- market over the course of 2010. Aerospace segment profit decreased by 18 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to lower sales as a result of the factors discussed above and inflation, partially offset by volume related material cost reductions and reduced labor costs (reflecting reduced census, work schedule reductions, benefits from prior repositioning actions and lower incentive compensation), the positive impact of cost savings initiatives and increased prices. Aerospace sales increased by 3 percent in 2008. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 6 percent in 2008. The decrease was driven by the sale of our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by increased deliveries to our air transport customers, notwithstanding a decrease in total aircraft production rates at major OEM’s mainly due to a strike at a major OEM, which was settled in the fourth quarter of 2008. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent in 2008 primarily due to increased volume, the price of spare parts and aftermarket growth driven by flight hour growth. The growth rate in global flying hours slowed to 3 percent in 2008, including a 2 percent decline in the fourth quarter. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 5 percent in 2008 due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries, improved pricing and continued additions to the fractional ownership and charter fleets. In 2008, sales to this end- market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts. Defense and space sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to logistics services (including the positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International, a defense logistics business), helicopter OE sales, an increase in government funded engineering related to the Orion (CEV) program, higher sales of specialty foam insulation, certain surface systems and classified space programs. Aerospace segment profit increased by 5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to increased prices, productivity and sales volume growth. These increases are partially offset by inflation, the Consumables Solutions divestiture and higher spending to support new platform growth.

Aerospace sales increased by 3 percent in 2008. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales decreased by 6 percent in 2008. The decrease is driven by the sale of our Consumables Solutions business, partially offset by increased deliveries to our air transport customers, notwithstanding a decrease in total aircraft production rates at major OEM’s mainly due to a strike at a major OEM, which was settled in the fourth quarter. We expect sales to OE customers to decline in the first quarter of 2009 due to reduced delivery schedules in light of order deferrals and cancellations and platform mix. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent in 2008 primarily due to increased volume, the price of spare parts and aftermarket growth driven by flight hour growth. Consistent with our previously reported expectations, the growth rate in global flying hours slowed to 3 percent in 2008, including a 2 percent decline in the fourth quarter and is expected to decline further in the first quarter of 2009. In addition, aftermarket customers may change buying patterns and reduce inventory levels. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 5 percent in 2008 due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries (which is expected to decline in the first quarter of 2009), improved pricing and continued additions to the fractional ownership and charter fleets (which is expected to decline in the first quarter of 2009). In 2008 sales to this end-market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts both of which are expected to decline in the first quarter of 2009, consistent with the expected decrease in business jet utilization. Defense and space sales increased by 6 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due to logistics services (including the positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International, a defense logistics business), helicopter OE sales, an increase in government funded engineering related to the Orion (CEV) program, higher sales of specialty foam insulation, certain surface systems and classified space programs. Aerospace segment profit increased by 5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to increased prices, productivity and sales volume growth. These increases are partially offset by inflation, the Consumable Solutions divestiture and higher spending to support new platform growth. We expect segment profit to decline in the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to the expected adverse sales impacts noted above. Aerospace sales increased by 10 percent in 2007. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales increased by 10 percent in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by increased deliveries to air transport customers primarily due to higher aircraft production rates at major OE manufacturers. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2007. The increase was a result of increased sales volumes and price of spare parts and maintenance activity relating to the approximately 6 percent increase in global flying hours. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 16 percent in 2007. The increase is due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries, as well as the launch of new aircraft platforms. Sales to this end-market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 16 percent in 2007. The was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts. Defense and space sales increased by 8 percent in 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher sales of surface systems, a 2 percent positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International and an increase in space sales, including engineering activities relating to the Orion (CEV) program. Aerospace segment profit increased by 16 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to sales volume growth, increased prices and productivity, partially offset by inflation.
.@0000773840.@HON.@2008-02-15.@Gross margin increased by 0.8 of a percentage point in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to (i) higher margins in our Specialty Materials segment of 1.0 percentage point mainly due to the continued growth of UOP, (ii) higher margins in our Aerospace segment of 0.8 of a percentage point mainly resulting from sales volume growth, increased prices and productivity savings, and (iii) lower pension and other post retirement benefits expense of 0.3 of a percentage point, which were partially offset by lower margins in our Transportation Systems segment of 1.0 percentage point primarily attributable to lower Consumer Products Group (“CPG”) sales volume and operational planning and production issues. Gross margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher margins in our Specialty Materials segment following our acquisition of full ownership of UOP (1.3 percentage points), and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 0.5 of a percentage point, partially offset by higher repositioning costs of 0.2 of a percentage point. Aerospace sales increased by 10 percent and 6 percent in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Details regarding the net increase in sales by customer end-markets for both 2007 and 2006 are as follows: Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales increased by 10 percent in 2007 and 14 percent in 2006 driven by increased deliveries to air transport customers primarily due to higher aircraft production rates at major OE manufacturers. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 8 percent in 2007 and 4 percent in 2006. The 2007 increase was a result of increased sales volume and price of spare parts and maintenance activity relating to the approximately 6 percent increase in global flying hours. The 2006 increase over 2005 was a result of increased sales of spare parts and maintenance activity relating to a more than 5 percent increase in global flying hours which more than offset the anticipated decline in the sales of upgrades and retrofits of avionics equipment to meet certain mandated regulatory standards. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 16 percent in both 2007 and 2006 due to continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries, as well as the launch of new aircraft platforms in 2007 and high demand in the fractional ownership market in 2006. In both 2007 and 2006, sales to this end-market primarily consisted of sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 16 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2006. The 2007 increase was primarily due to increased revenue under maintenance service agreements and higher sales of spare parts. The 2006 increase over 2005 was primarily due to higher sales of spare parts and increased maintenance activity resulting in part from higher engine utilization, partially offset by lower sales of mandated upgrades and retrofits of avionics equipment required in 2005 to meet certain mandated regulatory standards. Defense and space sales increased by 8 percent in 2007 and 3 percent in 2006. The 2007 increase was primarily due to, higher sales of surface systems, a 2 percent positive impact of the acquisition of Dimensions International (a defense logistics business) and an increase in space sales, including engineering activity relating to the Orion (CEV) program. The 2006 increase over 2005 was primarily due to higher sales of surface systems and sales of spare parts for helicopters that offset lower volume of space sales due to delays in project funding. Aerospace segment profit increased by 16 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 due primarily to sales volume growth, increased prices and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to sales volume growth, increased prices and productivity savings (including benefits from prior restructuring actions) that were partially offset by inflation and the impact of stronger OE sales that typically have lower margins than aftermarket sales. ACS sales increased by 13 percent in 2007 compared with 2006, including 4 percent favorable impact of foreign exchange and net growth from acquisitions and divestitures of 2 percent. Sales in our Products businesses grew by 11 percent, driven by (i) increased sales of security products primarily due to growth in intrusion products, European distribution sales and emerging markets, (ii) continued strong demand for life safety products and (iii) introduction of new environmental and combustion control products. Sales in our Solutions businesses increased by 17 percent with growth in all regions, driven by energy retrofit and refining services projects, global infrastructure expansion, continued growth in orders and conversion to sales from our order backlog, as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange. ACS sales increased by 17 percent in 2006 compared with 2005, including 7 percent net impact from acquisitions and divestitures.Sales grew by 19 percent in our Products businesses, due to 11 percent net impact from acquisitions and divestitures, as well as strong customer demand for new products in our security and life safety products and increased sales to customers in emerging markets for environmental, combustion, sensing and control products. Sales in our Solutions businesses increased by 14 percent driven by continued strong orders growth, strong conversion to sales from our order backlog and increased sales in emerging markets and strong revenue from energy projects and 3 percent net impact from acquisitions net of divestitures. Sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased by 7 percent in 2006 compared with 2005, largely representing revenues in ACS products businesses relating to NOVAR (primarily environmental, combustion, building controls and life safety products) for the first quarter of 2006, Zellweger (gas detection) for the first two quarters of 2006 and revenues from our Gardiner Groupe (security distribution) and First Technology (gas detection) acquisitions in the last three quarters of 2006. ACS segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to increased Products and Solutions sales volume and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation. We continue to experience a change in mix resulting from stronger sales growth in our Solutions businesses that historically have lower margins than our Products businesses. ACS segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to increased sales volume and productivity savings (including net integration savings from our acquisitions) that more than offset continued inflation. Segment profit was also negatively impacted in 2006 by a contract loss experienced on a Building Solutions project, and by ERP implementation costs.
.@0000773840.@HON.@2007-02-16.@Gross margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to higher margins in our Specialty Materials segment following our acquisition of full ownership of UOP (1.3 percentage points), and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 0.5 percentage points, partially offset by higher repositioning costs of 0.2 percentage points. Gross margin increased by 3.3 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to an increase of 1.2 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments, lower repositioning and other charges of 0.8 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 0.5 percentage points. For further discussion of segment results, see “Review of Business Segments”. Aerospace is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, avionics, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors. Our Aerospace products and services include auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, environmental control systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, management and technical services, advanced systems and instruments, aircraft wheels and brakes and repair and overhaul services. Aerospace sells its products to original equipment (OE) manufacturers in the air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft segments, and provides spare parts and repair and maintenance services for the aftermarket (principally to aircraft operators). The United States Government is also a major customer for our defense and space products. Economic and Other Factors Aerospace operating results are principally driven by: Global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, as well as the demand for spare parts and maintenance and repair services for aircraft currently in use; Aircraft production by commercial air transport, regional jet, business and general aviation OE manufacturers, as well as global flying hours and airline profitability; The level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs and military activity; and Pricing, volatility in pricing and availability of raw materials. Air transport and regional original equipment (OE) sales increased by 14 percent in 2006 and 9 percent in 2005 primarily driven by increased deliveries to air transport customers primarily due to higher aircraft production rates. Air transport and regional aftermarket sales increased by 4 percent in 2006 as a result of increased sales of spare parts and maintenance activity relating to a more than 5 percent increase in global flying hours which more than offset the anticipated decline in the sales of upgrades and retrofits of avionics equipment to meet certain mandated regulatory standards. In 2005, sales increased by 3 percent due primarily to a 7 percent increase in flying hours which was partially offset by a decrease in the level of FAA-mandated safety avionics equipment upgrades and retrofits and the impact of the phase-out of regional aircraft with turboprop engines. Business and general aviation OE sales increased by 16 percent in 2006 and by 42 percent in 2005 due primarily to the continued demand in the business jet end market as evidenced by an increase in new business jet deliveries and high demand in the fractional ownership market. These sales primarily relate to sales of Primus Epic integrated avionics systems, and the TFE 731 and HTF 7000 engines, which generated sales commencing in 2005. Business and general aviation aftermarket sales increased by 1 percent in 2006, due to increased sales of spare parts and increased maintenance activity resulting in part from higher engine utilization, partially offset lower sales of mandated upgrades and retrofits of avionics equipment required in the prior year to meet certain mandated regulatory standards. In 2005, sales increased by 10 percent due to these mandates, and as a result of increased engine utilization for corporate aircraft. Defense and space sales increased by 3 percent in 2006 primarily due to higher sales of surface systems and sales of spare parts for helicopters that offset lower volume of space sales due to delays in project funding. In 2005, defense and space sales increased by 2 percent, primarily driven by platform upgrades for war-related activities, growth in precision munitions and increased spending on restricted space programs. These factors lower replenishment demand for spare parts from the US military in both 2005 and 2006. Aerospace segment profit increased by 13 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due primarily to sales volume growth, increased prices and productivity savings (including benefits from prior restructuring actions) that were partially offset by inflation and the impact of stronger OE sales that typically have lower margins than aftermarket sales. Segment profit increased by 18 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to volume growth and the effect of productivity actions, partially offset by an increase in spending for information technology systems. ACS provides innovative solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites, airport facilities and infrastructure more efficient, safe and comfortable. Our ACS products and services include controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; access control; video surveillance; remote patient monitoring systems; installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive; and automation and control solutions for industrial plants, including advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings. ACS sales increased by 17 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to organic sales growth of 10 percent and 7 percent growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures. All of ACS businesses contributed to organic growth in the year. In 2005 sales increased by 17 percent compared to 2004, which was primarily due to growth from acquisitions of 13 percent and organic growth of 4 percent. Organic sales growth in ACS products businesses increased by 8 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to strong customer demand for new products in our security and life safety products and increased sales to customers in emerging markets for environmental, combustion, sensing and control products. In 2005, organic sales for products increased by 5 percent compared to 2004, primarily due to strong sales of fire solutions and security products, and the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Organic sales in ACS solutions businesses increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 driven by continued strong orders growth, strong conversion to sales from our order backlog and increased sales in emerging markets and strong revenue from energy projects. In 2005, organic sales growth for the solutions businesses was 3 percent compared to 2004 due primarily to favorable foreign exchange and increased capital spending. Sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased by 7 percent in 2006 compared with 2005, largely representing revenues in ACS products businesses relating to NOVAR (primarily environmental, combustion, building controls and life safety products) for the first quarter of 2006, Zellweger (gas detection) for the first two quarters of 2006 and revenues from our Gardiner Groupe (security distribution) and First Technology (gas detection) acquisitions in the last three quarters of 2006. In 2005, sales from acquisitions net of divestitures increased by 13 percent compared to 2004, due primarily to the acquisition of NOVAR, partially offset by the loss of sales due to the divestiture of our Security Monitoring business. ACS segment profit increased by 15 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to increased sales volume and productivity savings (including net integration savings from our acquisitions) that more than offset continued inflation. Segment profit was also negatively impacted in 2006 by a contract loss experienced on a Building Solutions project, and by ERP implementation costs. ACS segment profit in 2005 increased by 19 percent compared with 2004 as the favorable effects of productivity actions, acquisitions (NOVAR) and higher sales volume more than offset the unfavorable effects of lower prices and investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Specialty Materials sales increased by 43 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to organic sales growth of 7 percent and 36 percent growth due to our UOP acquisition, net of divestitures. Sales decreased by 8 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, due to the loss of sales from divested businesses of 16 percent, which was offset by organic growth of 4 percent and growth from acquisitions (UOP) of 4 percent. Organic growth was 7 percent in 2006 primarily due to higher volume and prices. Organic sales in our Fluorine Products business increased by 9 percent due to continued strong demand for non-ozone depleting HFC products, and organic growth in our Resins and Chemicals business was 4 percent, primarily due to price increases to recover increased raw material costs. Both of these businesses experienced lower sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to the slowdown in the US residential housing industry. Our Resins and Chemicals business was also negatively impacted by a partial facility outage in the second half of 2006. Specialty Products organic sales increased by 10 percent due to higher sales to our customers in the semiconductor industry and increased sales of our specialty additives and our advanced fiber body armor. In 2005, organic sales increased by 4 percent, largely as a result of higher prices of 7 percent primarily in our Resins and Chemicals and Fluorine businesses, offsetting lower volumes in Specialty Products businesses. Sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures grew by 36 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. This was due to a 44 percent growth in sales from UOP, which was consolidated into the Specialty Materials segment following our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in UOP in November 2005. Prior to that date, UOP results were included in other income. UOP sales have grown due to continued strength in the petrochemical and refining industries. This growth was offset by the loss of sales of 8 percent principally from the divestiture of our Industrial Wax and North American Nylon Fiber businesses. Specialty Materials segment profit increased by 121 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due principally to the impact of the UOP acquisition, net of divestitures, and increased organic growth and productivity savings (net of the lost margin from the partial facility outage). Price increases (including benefits from formula based pricing contracts) offset the impact of continued inflation in raw material costs. Specialty Materials segment profit in 2005 increased by 40 percent compared with 2004 due principally to price increases and the favorable effect of productivity actions partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes.
.@0000773840.@HON.@2006-03-01.@This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell's four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including how they generate income, the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and business challenges and areas of focus in both the short- and long-term. Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. ACS provides innovative solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and airport facilities more efficient, safe and comfortable. Our ACS products and services include controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature and electrical current; security, fire and gas detection; access control; video surveillance; and remote patient monitoring systems; installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive; and automation and control solutions for industrial plants, including advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings. Gross margin increased in 2005 by 2.8 percentage points compared with 2004. The increase resulted from an increase of 1.1 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments (see Review of Business Segments for a discussion of our segment results). The increase also resulted from lower repositioning and other charges of 1.2 percentage points and lower pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 0.5 percentage points. Gross margin decreased in 2004 by 1.5 percentage points compared with 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in repositioning and other charges of 1.2 percentage points and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of 0.9 percentage points partially offset by an increase of 0.6 percentage points in gross margin for our reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 0.4 percentage points in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of Novar and higher spending for information technology systems (primarily ERP system in Aerospace) of 0.3 percentage points and higher repositioning and other charges of 0.1 percentage points. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 0.2 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003 due to increases in pension and other postretirement benefits expense and net repositioning and other charges of 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of 0.1 percentage points due primarily to higher sales. Pension expense decreased by $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due principally to a decrease in the amortization of unrecognized net losses partially offset by pension expense for Novar, which was acquired in 2005. Pension expense increased by $276 million in 2004 compared with 2003 due primarily to an increase in the amortization of unrecognized net losses resulting mainly from actual plan asset returns below the expected rate of return during the period 2000 to 2002 and a decrease in the discount rate for each year since 2001. Other postretirement benefits expense decreased by $59 million in 2005 compared with 2004 due primarily to the effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. See Note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further discussion. Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2005 increased by 17 percent compared with 2004 due to acquisitions (mainly Novar's IBS business), net of divestitures, of 13 percent, higher volumes of 4 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 1 percent, partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent. Sales increased by 26 percent for our Products businesses driven primarily by the acquisition of Novar's IBS business. The increase was also due to volume growth and other acquisitions in our security and life safety businesses. Sales for our Building Solutions business increased by 10 percent due primarily to the acquisition of Novar's IBS business and growth in security and energy retrofits partially offset by the divestiture of our Security Monitoring business in the prior year. Sales for our Process Solutions business increased by 4 percent primarily due to an acquisition and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2004 increased by 8 percent compared with 2003 due to higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 4 percent, partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent. Sales increased by 9 percent for our Products businesses due principally to strong sales of fire solutions, environmental controls and sensor products, and the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions. Sales for our Process Solutions business increased by 8 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and improvement in industrial production and capital spending. Sales for our Building Solutions business increased by 5 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and the impact of investments in sales and marketing initiatives, partially offset by the divestiture of our Security Monitoring business. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2005 increased by 19 percent compared with 2004 as the favorable effects of productivity actions, acquisitions (principally IBS) and higher sales volume (due in part to new products) more than offset the unfavorable effects of lower prices and investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2004 increased by 6 percent compared with 2003 due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes partially offset by increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher research and development costs to support new product introductions. Segment profit was also adversely impacted in 2003 by pricing pressures across all businesses. In 2005, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $267 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 5,269 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments including the implementation of a new organizational structure in our Aerospace reportable segment which reorganized our Aerospace businesses to better align with customer segments. The implementation of the new Aerospace organizational structure was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2005. Also, $25 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance at our Corporate, Specialty Materials and Automation and Control Solutions reportable segments were returned to income in 2005. The reversal of severance liabilities relates to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs, excise taxes relating to executive severance amounts previously paid which were determined to no longer be payable, and severance amounts previously paid to an outside service provider as part of an outsourcing arrangement which were refunded to Honeywell. In 2004, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $116 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 2,272 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments. Also, $28 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income in 2004, due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions, resulting in reduced severance liabilities principally in our Automation and Control Solutions reportable segment. In 2003, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $82 million primarily for severance costs related to workforce reductions of 1,501 manufacturing and administrative positions across all of our reportable segments. Also, $69 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income in 2003, due to fewer employee separations than originally planned associated with certain prior repositioning actions, resulting in reduced severance liabilities in our Automation and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Specialty Materials reportable segments. Our 2005 repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of approximately $170 million in 2006 compared with 2005 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute our repositioning actions were $171, $164 and $200 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such expenditures for severance and other exit costs have been funded principally through operating cash flows. Cash expenditures for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute the remaining actions will approximate $125 million in 2006 and will be funded principally through operating cash flows. In 2005, we recognized a charge of $186 million for environmental liabilities deemed probable and reasonably estimable. We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $10 million which are discussed in detail in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. We recognized a credit of $67 million in connection with an arbitration award for overcharges by a supplier of phenol to our Specialty Materials business from June 2003 through the end of 2004. The arbitrator has also awarded Honeywell an additional $31 million of damages for overcharges in 2005, which has not been recognized as the overcharges for the years 2005 forward are subject to a separate arbitration scheduled for April 2006. The existing arbitration awards for 2003 to 2005 are subject to approval in federal court. We recognized impairment charges of $23 million related to the write-down of property, plant and equipment held and used in our Research and Life Sciences business and the write-down of property, plant and equipment held for sale in our Resins and Chemicals business, both in our Specialty Materials reportable segment. We also recognized other charges of $18 million principally related to the modification of a lease agreement for the Corporate headquarters facility ($10 million) and for various legal settlements ($7 million). In 2004, we recognized a charge of $536 million for probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities primarily related to the denial of our appeal of the matter entitled Interfaith Community Organization, et. al. v. Honeywell International Inc., et al., and estimated liabilities for remediation of environmental conditions in and around Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, New York. Both of these environmental matters are discussed in further detail in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We recognized asbestos related litigation charges, net of insurance, of $76 million which are discussed in detail in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. We recognized an impairment charge of $42 million in the second quarter of 2004 related principally to the write-down of property, plant and equipment of our Performance Fibers business in our Specialty Materials reportable segment. This business was sold in December 2004. We also recognized other charges of $33 million consisting of $29 million for various legal settlements including property damage claims in our Automation and Control Solutions reportable segment, $14 million for the write-off of receivables, inventories and other assets net of a reversal of a reserve of $10 million established in the prior year for a contract settlement. In 2003, we recognized a charge of $235 million for probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities mainly related to the matter entitled Interfaith Community Organization, et al. v. Honeywell International Inc., et al. and for remediation of environmental conditions in and around Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, New York, both as discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” We also recognized other charges of $30 million consisting of $26 million for various legal settlements and $4 million in our Specialty Materials reportable segment including a loss on sale of an investment owned by an equity investee.
.@0000773840.@HON.@2005-02-25.@This Business Overview provides a summary of Honeywell's four reportable operating segments (Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Specialty Materials and Transportation Systems), including how they generate income, the relevant economic and other factors impacting their results, and business challenges and areas of focus in both the short- and long-term. Each of these segments is comprised of various business units and product classes that serve multiple end markets. See Note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on our reportable segments and our definition of segment profit. Aerospace is a leading global supplier of aircraft engines, avionics, and related products and services for commercial airlines, business and regional aircraft, manned and unmanned military aircraft, and spacecraft. Our Aerospace portfolio includes Engines, Systems and Services (auxiliary power units; propulsion engines; environmental control systems; engine controls; repair and overhaul services; hardware; logistics; and electric power systems); Aerospace Electronic Systems (flight safety, communications, navigation, radar and surveillance systems; aircraft and airport lighting; management and technical services and advanced systems and instruments); and Aircraft Landing Systems (aircraft wheels and brakes). Aerospace sells its products to original equipment (OE) manufacturers in the commercial air transport and business and regional aircraft segments, as well as spare parts into the aftermarket (principally to aircraft operators). The United States Government is also a major customer for our defense and space products. ACS provides innovative solutions that make homes, buildings, industrial sites and airport facilities more efficient, safe and comfortable. Our ACS portfolio includes Automation and Control Products (controls for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification and home automation; advanced software applications for home/building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for measuring pressure, air flow, temperature, electrical current; and security and fire detection, access control, video surveillance and remote patient monitoring systems); Building Solutions (installs, maintains and upgrades systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive); and Process Solutions (provides a full range of automation and control solutions for industrial plants, offering advanced software and automation systems that integrate, control and monitor complex processes in many types of industrial settings). Gross margin decreased in 2004 by 1.5 percentage points compared with 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in net repositioning and other charges of $349 million, higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $249 million and an increase in research and development expense of $166 million, partially offset by an increase in sales of higher-margin products and services, mainly in our Aerospace reportable segment. Gross margin increased in 2003 by 0.2 percentage points compared with 2002. The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in net repositioning and other charges of $289 million partially offset by higher pension expense and a decrease in sales of higher-margin products and services, mainly in our Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $366 million, or 12 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 due to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $155 million due in part to higher spending for information technology systems, an increase in selling expenses of $136 million from higher sales and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $54 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $193 million, or 7 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 due primarily to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $120 million due in part to an increase in other employee benefit expenses, and higher pension and other postretirement benefits expense of $56 million. Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses of $255 million in 2004 represents the pretax gains on the sales of our Security Monitoring and VCSEL Optical Products businesses in our Automation and Control Solutions reportable segment of $215 and $36 million, respectively. The gain also includes adjustments of $19 million related to businesses sold in prior periods and the pretax loss of $15 million on the sale of our Performance Fibers business in our Specialty Materials reportable segment. The dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2004 compared with 2003. Gain on sale of non-strategic businesses of $38 million in 2003 represents the net pretax gain on the dispositions of certain Specialty Materials (Engineering Plastics, Rudolstadt and Metglas) and Aerospace (Honeywell Aerospace Defense Services) businesses. The dispositions of these businesses did not materially impact net sales and segment profit in 2003 compared with 2002. Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2004 increased by 8 percent compared with 2003 due to higher volumes of 5 percent and the favorable effect of foreign exchange of 4 percent, partially offset by the impact of lower prices of 1 percent. Sales increased by 9 percent for our Automation and Control Products businesses due principally to strong sales of fire solutions, environmental controls and sensor products, and the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions. Sales for our Process Solutions business increased by 8 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and improvement in industrial production and capital spending. Sales for our Building Solutions business increased by 5 percent due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and the impact of investments in sales and marketing initiatives, partially offset by the divestiture of our Security Monitoring business. Automation and Control Solutions sales in 2003 increased by 7 percent compared with 2002 due to favorable effects of foreign exchange of 5 percent and acquisitions, net of the disposition of our Consumer Products business, of 4 percent, partially offset by the impact of lower prices and volumes of 1 percent each. Sales increased by 11 percent for our Automation and Control Products businesses as the favorable effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions, mainly Invensys Sensor Systems (Invensys), more than offset the impact of the disposition of our Consumer Products business and lower volumes. Sales for our Process Solutions business increased by 4 percent due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange partially offset by lower unit volumes. Sales for our Building Solutions business increased by 2 percent as the favorable effect of foreign exchange more than offset lower volumes due to continued softness in the non-residential construction market. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2004 increased by 6 percent compared with 2003 due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes partially offset by increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives and higher research and development costs to support new product introductions. Automation and Control Solutions segment profit in 2003 decreased by 2 percent compared with 2002 due mainly to the decline in higher-margin energy-retrofit and discretionary spot sales in our Building Solutions business, and increased research and development expense and investments in sales and marketing initiatives, mainly in our Automation and Control Products and Building Solutions businesses, respectively. Segment profit was also adversely impacted in 2003 by pricing pressures mainly in our Automation and Control Products and Process Solutions businesses.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2019-02-22.@ The Overview presented below is an executive-level summary highlighting the key trends and measures on which the Company’s management focuses in evaluating its financial condition and operating performance. Certain earnings and performance measures within the Overview include financial information determined on a non-GAAP basis, which aligns with how management internally evaluates the Company's results of operations, determines incentive compensation, and assesses the impact of known trends and uncertainties on the business. A detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures referenced herein to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures follows this summary. For a detailed analysis of the Company's operations prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), referred to as "reported" herein, refer to the discussion and analysis in the Consolidated Results of Operations. In 2018, we made strong progress on our strategic initiatives, including strengthening our U.S. core confection business, expanding our snacks portfolio to capture incremental consumer occasions and optimizing the product portfolio across various international markets. We continued to generate solid operating cash flow, totaling approximately $1.6 billion in 2018, which affords the Company significant financial flexibility. In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. ("Amplify"), previously a publicly traded company based in Austin, Texas that owns several popular better-for-you snack brands such as SkinnyPop, Oatmega, Paqui and Tyrrells. Amplify's anchor brand, SkinnyPop, is a market-leading ready-to-eat popcorn brand and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States. The business enables us to capture more consumer snacking occasions by contributing a new portfolio of brands. On July 5, 2018, we sold the Tyrrells business in order to focus on the U.S. growth opportunities. In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Pirate Brands, which includes the Pirate's Booty, Smart Puffs and Original Tings brands, from B&G Foods, Inc. Pirate Brands offers baked, trans fat free and gluten free snacks and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States. Our full year 2018 net sales totaled $7,791.1 million, an increase of 3.7%, versus $7,515.4 million for the comparable period of 2017. Excluding a 0.2% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 3.9%. Net sales growth was driven primarily by the revenue contributions from Amplify and Pirate Brands. Our reported gross margin was 45.9% for the full year 2018, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the full year 2017. Our 2018 non-GAAP gross margin was 44.0%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the full year 2017 due to higher freight and logistics costs, unfavorable mix and additional plant costs related to new production lines. Our full year 2018 reported operating profit and reported operating profit margin totaled $1,623.7 million and 20.8%, respectively, compared to full year 2017 reported operating profit and reported operating profit margin of $1,313.4 million and 17.5%, respectively. From a non-GAAP perspective, full year 2018 adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin totaled $1,607.1 million and 20.6%, respectively, compared to full year 2017 adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin of $1,556.5 million and 20.7%, respectively. The decrease in our adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to lower non-GAAP gross margin. Our full year 2018 reported net income and reported EPS-diluted totaled $1,177.6 million and $5.58, respectively, compared to full year 2017 reported net income and reported EPS-diluted of $783.0 million and $3.66, respectively. From a non-GAAP perspective, full year 2018 adjusted net income was $1,130.1 million, an increase of 12.8% versus adjusted net income of $1,001.5 million in 2017. Our adjusted EPS-diluted for the full year 2018 was $5.36 compared to $4.69 for the same period of 2017, an increase of 14.3%. The increases in our adjusted net income and adjusted EPS-diluted in 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to slightly lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses, as well as a lower 2018 tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by unfavorable gross profit. The mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives are recorded as unallocated and excluded from adjusted results until such time as the related inventory is sold, at which time the corresponding (gains) losses are reclassified from unallocated to segment income. Since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years, we make this adjustment to facilitate the year-over-year comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the net adjustment recognized within unallocated was a gain of $168.3 million, a gain of $35.3 million and a loss of $163.2 million, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance long-term profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $51.8 million, $69.4 million and $93.9 million, respectively, of pre-tax costs related to business realignment activities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred expenses totaling $44.8 million related to the acquisitions of Amplify and Pirate Brands. This primarily includes legal and consultant fees, as well as severance and other costs relating to the integration of the businesses. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses totaling $0.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively, related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of Ripple Brand Collective, LLC, as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems. In 2018, settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the Company under a voluntary separation plan included within the Operational Optimization Program (as defined below). In 2017, settlement charges were triggered in the pension plan benefiting our employees in Puerto Rico as a result of lump sum distributions and the purchase of annuity contracts relating to the termination of this plan. In 2016, settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the Company under a voluntary separation plan included within the 2015 Productivity Initiative (as defined below). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $57.7 million of pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges to adjust the long-lived asset values of certain disposal groups, including the SGM and Tyrrells businesses, the Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. joint venture and other assets. These charges represent the excess of the disposal groups' carrying values, including the related currency translation adjustment amounts realized or to be realized upon completion of the sales, over the sales values less costs to sell for the respective businesses. The fair values of the disposal groups were supported by the sales prices paid by third-party buyers or estimated sales prices based on marketing of the disposal group, when the sale has not yet been completed. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $208.7 million of pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges related to certain business realignment activities. This included a write-down of certain intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 SGM acquisition and a write-down of property, plant and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in India. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a net benefit of $7.8 million as a measurement period adjustment to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, recorded in connection with the enactment of U.S. tax reform in December 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net charge of $32.5 million, which included the estimated impact of the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries offset in part by the benefit from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate. Certain of the business realignment and impairment charges recorded in connection with the Margin for Growth Program related to Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd., a joint venture in which we own a 50% controlling interest. Therefore, we have also adjusted for the portion of these charges included within the loss attributed to the non-controlling interest. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the SGM selling shareholders to reduce the originally-agreed purchase price for the remaining 20% of SGM, and we completed the purchase on February 3, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a $26.7 million gain relating to the settlement of the SGM liability, representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares. During the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a $2.7 million gain on the sale of licensing rights for a non-core trademark relating to a brand marketed outside of the U.S. Net sales increased 3.7% in 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting a benefit from the recent Amplify and Pirate Brands acquisitions of 3.6% and a volume increase of 1.3%, partially offset by unfavorable price realization of 1.0% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased 3.9%. Consolidated volumes increased due to the acquisitions of Amplify and Pirate Brands, as well as solid performance in select international markets, which more than offset the volume reduction resulting from the sale of SGM in July 2018. The net increase in volume was partially offset by unfavorable net price realization, which was primarily attributed to incremental trade promotional expense in the North America segment in support of 2018 programming. Net sales increased 1.0% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting favorable price realization of 0.7%, a benefit from acquisitions of 0.3%, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.2%. Excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 0.8% in 2017. The favorable net price realization was attributed to lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the North America and International and Other segments versus the prior year. Consolidated volume decreased as a result of lower sales volume in the International and Other segment, primarily attributed to our China business and the softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings. These volume decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in North America, specifically from 2017 innovation and new launches, including Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Hershey's Gold and Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2018-02-27.@ The Overview presented below is an executive-level summary highlighting the key trends and measures on which the Company’s management focuses in evaluating its financial condition and operating performance.

For a detailed analysis of the Company's operations prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), referred to as "reported" herein, refer to the discussion and analysis in the Consolidated Results of Operations. In 2017, we made solid progress on our strategic initiatives, including strengthening our core chocolate brands, positioning our snacks business for success and generating operating profit margin expansion. These initiatives will benefit the Company over the long term and enable us to achieve our sales and earnings per share-diluted ("EPS") targets. We continued to generate solid operating cash flow, totaling approximately $1.2 billion in 2017, which affords the Company significant financial flexibility. The recent acquisition of Amplify is an important step in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking as it should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. Our full year 2017 net sales totaled $7,515.4 million, an increase of 1.0%, versus $7,440.2 million for the comparable period of 2016. Excluding a 0.2% impact from favorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 0.8%. Net sales growth was driven by lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the North America and International and Other segments, as well as higher sales volume in North America, primarily from 2017 innovation and new launches, including Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Hershey's Gold and Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels. Our reported gross margin was 45.8% for the full year 2017, an increase of 340 basis points compared to the full year 2016. Our 2017 non-GAAP gross margin of 45.6% was on par with the prior year margin, as the benefits from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives, as well as lower input costs, were offset by higher freight rates and increased levels of manufacturing and distribution costs associated with an effort to maintain customer service targets at fast growing retail customers. Our full year 2017 reported net income and EPS-diluted totaled $783.0 million and $3.66, respectively, compared to the full year 2016 reported net income and EPS-diluted of $720.0 million and $3.34, respectively. From a non-GAAP perspective, full year 2017 adjusted net income was $1,016.9 million, an increase of 7.2% versus $948.5 million in 2016. Our adjusted EPS-diluted for the full year 2017 was $4.76 compared to $4.41 for the same period of 2016, an increase of 7.9%. The comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives, costs associated with business realignment activities, costs relating to the integration of acquisitions, non-service related components of our pension expense ("NSRPE"), impairment of goodwill, indefinite and long-lived assets, settlement of the SGM liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of SGM, the gain realized on the sale of a trademark, costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt and other non-recurring gains and losses. To provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance, we use non-GAAP financial measures within MD&A that exclude the financial impact of these activities. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business, but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures referenced in MD&A to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income is provided below. Net sales increased 1.0% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting favorable price realization of 0.7%, a benefit from acquisitions of 0.3%, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.2%. Excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 0.8% in 2017. The favorable net price realization was attributed to lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the North America and International and Other segments versus the prior year. Consolidated volume decreased as a result of lower sales volume in the International and Other segment, primarily attributed to our China business and the softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings. These volume decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in North America, specifically from 2017 innovation and new launches, including Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Hershey's Gold and Hershey's and Reese's Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels. Net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting volume increases of 0.8% and a 0.6% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.7%. Excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 1.4% in 2016. The volume improvement was primarily driven by new chocolate and snacking products in the United States, including Snack Mix, Snack Bites and Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars. While the North America segment had unfavorable price realization due to increased levels of trade promotional spending, this was essentially offset by favorable price realization in the International and Other segment, due to significantly lower levels of trade spending and returns, discounts and allowances. For the full year 2017, our U.S. candy, mint and gum ("CMG") consumer takeaway increased 1.6%, which was in line with the category increase, resulting in market share of 30.6%. The CMG consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Information Resources, Incorporated ("IRI"), the Company's market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. The amounts presented above are solely for the U.S. CMG category which does not include revenue from our snack mixes and grocery items. For the full year 2017, our U.S. retail takeaway increased 1.2% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (IRI MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks and grocery items. The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments: North America and International and Other. The segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis. For segment reporting purposes, we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition integration costs and NSRPE that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the CODM and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Information section of this MD&A.

We report our operations through two segments: North America and International and Other. In 2016, we made good progress against our strategic objectives, including a focus on our consumer brand engagement and continued refinement of our mix of marketing investments. These initiatives, as well as improved analytics, operating efficiencies and new information technology capabilities, strengthened our business model and positioned the Company for future growth. We continued to generate solid operating cash flow, totaling approximately $1 billion in 2016, which affords the Company significant financial flexibility. We are also in the process of conducting a strategic review of our global cost structure that we believe will result in solid gross and earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") margin expansion once executed. Our 2016 marketplace performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other consumer packaged goods ("CPG") companies. Additionally, the U.S. candy, mint and gum ("CMG") category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter Easter season and merchandising and display strategies at select customers.  For the full year, U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 0.4%, lower than the historical average. Our U.S. CMG market share performance improved in the second half of 2016, resulting in full year market share of 31.2%, including barkTHINS, which is approximately in line with the prior year. For the full year 2016, our U.S. market share, including CMG, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks, grocery items and barkTHINS, increased approximately 10 basis points. Our full year 2016 net sales totaled $7,440.2 million, an increase of 0.7% versus $7,386.6 million in 2015. Excluding a 0.7% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.4%. The increase was driven by higher North America volumes, largely in products supported by increased promotional programming such as NCAA March Madness, the Summer Olympics and NCAA Football College Game Day, as well as new product innovation such as Snack Mix, Snack Bites and Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars. Additionally, our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $35.6 million attributed to barkTHINS. Our full year 2016 net income and earnings per share-diluted (EPS) increased 40.4% and 44.0%, respectively, compared to 2015 results, which were impacted by significant goodwill impairment charges. Excluding these goodwill impairment charges in 2015 and other items impacting comparability in both periods (as defined in the Non-GAAP Information section of this MD&A), 2016 adjusted net income increased 4.3%, reflecting the benefits from continued productivity and cost savings initiatives and a lower effective income tax rate, while adjusted EPS-diluted also benefited from recent share buybacks, increasing a total of 7.0%. For 2017, we expect net sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%, which includes a 0.5% net benefit from acquisitions and a 0.25% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.25% to 3.25%. Our focus is on the continued rollout of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars, barkTHINS chocolate distribution gains and other new products such as Reese's Crunchers candy and Krave meat bars and sticks. We anticipate that these investments and related consumer marketing plans will accelerate our North America sales growth versus 2016 performance, which should enable us to outpace the broader food group in this challenging operating environment. Our previously discussed productivity and cost savings programs are on track, and we will continue to focus on reducing non-essential spending going into 2017. Additionally, our effective tax rate is expected to be favorable versus 2016 driven by a favorable international tax mix, tax credits and other incentives, and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. As a result, we expect full year 2017 reported EPS-diluted, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), to improve and be in the $4.54 to $4.65 range. From a non-GAAP perspective, we currently expect 2017 adjusted EPS-diluted to increase approximately 7% to 9% and to be in the $4.72 to $4.81 range. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2017 are reflected in the non-GAAP reconciliations that follow. The comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives, costs associated with business realignment activities, costs relating to the integration of acquisitions, non-service related components of our pension expense (income) ("NSRPE(I)"), goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, settlement of the SGM liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of SGM, the gain realized on the sale of a trademark, costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt and other non-recurring gains and losses. To provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance, we use non-GAAP financial measures within MD&A that exclude the financial impact of these activities. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business, but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures referenced in MD&A to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income is provided below. Net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting volume increases of 0.8% and a 0.6% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.7%. Excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 1.4% in 2016. The volume improvement was primarily driven by new chocolate and snacking products in the United States, including Snack Mix, Snack Bites and Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch bars. While the North America segment had unfavorable price realization due to increased levels of trade promotional spending, this was essentially offset by favorable price realization in the International and Other segment, due to significantly lower levels of trade spending and returns, discounts and allowances. Net sales decreased 0.5% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting volume declines of 3.4% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.6%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 3.5% as well as a 1.0% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures. The favorable net price realization, primarily in the United States, was attributed to the price increase announced in mid-2014. The volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the United States as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in North America, coupled with lower sales in China. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.1% in 2015. The consumer takeaway and market share information provided above are for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. The amounts presented above are solely for the U.S. CMG category which does not include revenue from our snack mixes and grocery items. For the full year 2016, our CMG market share, including barkTHINS was 31.2%, about the same as 2015. Including barkTHINS, CMG, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks and grocery items, our full year U.S. market share increased approximately 10 basis points. Cost of sales increased 7.0% in 2016 compared with 2015. Incremental business realignment costs and mark-to-market losses on commodity derivative instruments increased cost of sales by 5.3%, while the remaining increase was primarily attributed to higher volume and higher supply chain costs, in part due to higher manufacturing variances and some incremental fixed costs related to the commencement of manufacturing in the Malaysia facility. As described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our commodity derivative instruments are no longer designated for hedge accounting treatment and, as a result, the changes in fair market value are recognized currently in cost of sales. Gross margin decreased by 340 basis points in 2016 compared with 2015. Mark-to-market losses on commodity derivative instruments and incremental depreciation expense related to business realignment activities drove a 300 basis point decline in gross margin. Higher trade promotional spending and supply chain costs also contributed to the decreased gross margin, but were partially offset by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the losses on commodity derivative instruments as well as business realignment costs, 2016 adjusted gross margin decreased by 40 basis points. Cost of sales decreased 2.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. Supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.6%. These declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs, and unfavorable sales mix, which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 4.1%. In addition, cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of $7.3 million, business realignment costs of $8.8 million and NSRPE of $2.5 million, which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 0.5%. In comparison, cost of sales benefited by $1.1 million in 2014, primarily due to NSRPI. Gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. Favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points. However, these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix, which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges, 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expenses decreased $53.9 million or 2.7% in 2016. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense decreased 4.0% during this period. We spent less on advertising and related consumer marketing in our International and Other segment, particularly in the China market, and our spending in North America declined as our marketing mix models were weighted toward higher trade promotional spending. Excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased by 2.0% as compared to 2015 as a result of our continued focus on reducing non-essential spending. SM&A expenses in 2016 were also impacted by business realignment costs of $18.6 million, NSRPE of $15.2 million and acquisition and integration costs of $6.5 million. In 2015, SM&A expenses included business realignment costs of $17.4 million, NSRPE of $15.6 million and acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million. SM&A expenses increased $70.9 million or 3.7% in 2015. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1.0% during this period. Excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 6.7% compared to 2014, driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses. Excluding the impact of acquisition costs, SM&A expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on reducing non-essential spending. SM&A expenses in 2015 were also impacted by charges of $13.6 million attributed to the productivity initiative we announced in June 2015, acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million, NSRPE of $15.6 million and other business realignment costs of $3.7 million. In 2014, SM&A expenses included acquisition and integration costs of $12.4 million, other business realignment costs of $2.9 million and NSRPE of $0.9 million. In 2016, in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million, primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in India. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the SGM business performed below expectations throughout 2015, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. As of result of this declining performance, in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $249.8 million relating to the SGM reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2015, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. We also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the SGM reporting unit, which resulted in an additional $16.6 million write-off of this increase to goodwill. During the third quarter of 2015, we also wrote off $14.4 million of goodwill that resulted from the SGM acquisition and was assigned to our existing China chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of Golden Monkey-branded product through its Tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. This goodwill impairment was driven by the continued declining performance in our China chocolate business through the third quarter of 2015, as a result of the macroeconomic challenges mentioned previously, as well as changing consumer shopping behavior in China. In 2014, the annual impairment testing of our India reporting unit resulted in a $11.4 million goodwill impairment charge and a $4.5 million write-down of a trademark associated with the India business. These impairment charges were largely a result of our decision at the time to exit the oils portion of the India business and realign our approach to regional marketing and distribution in India. The assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2016-02-26.@We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. We report our operations through two segments: North America and International and Other. We continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives in 2015, including margin expansion in our North America segment which fuels our earnings per share and enables us to make investments in other parts of the business, a demonstrated commitment to transparency and simple ingredients to satisfy evolving consumer preferences, additional investments in our snacks business, and a continued focus on insights and knowledge to identify and respond to changing consumer and retail trends and practices. Our 2015 financial performance was impacted by a continued slow-down in U.S. retail take-away, an increase in competitive activity and poor performance in China. For the full year 2015, our U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4%, which was largely in line with the category growth rate but continues to be down from long-term historical average of 3-4%. We believe the category is being impacted by changing consumer shopping habits like channel shifting and e-commerce, increased competitive activity and higher levels of merchandising and display, and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace, which appears to be adversely impacting purchases of non-seasonal candy products. Our Shanghai Golden Monkey (“SGM”) business has performed below expectations since its initial acquisition in 2014, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. In addition, as part of our ongoing integration process, we assessed the quality of SGM’s accounts receivable and existing distributor networks. Based on the declining performance levels and the results of our integration assessments, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of July 5, 2015, which resulted in a preliminary $249.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the goodwill related to the SGM reporting unit as of July 5, 2015. During the third quarter, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. We also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the SGM reporting unit, which resulted in a write-off of this additional goodwill, for a total impairment of $266.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the selling SGM shareholders to reduce the originally-agreed purchase price for the remaining 20% of SGM, and we completed the purchase on February 3, 2016. We are directing our efforts currently on developing an integration plan that is focused on the optimal structure for top-line growth. Macroeconomic challenges and changing consumer shopping behavior adversely impacted our China chocolate business during 2015. The China chocolate category performance continues to be below the historical compound annual growth rate of 11-12% as marketplace trends continue to slow across all channels. As a result of the declining performance in our China chocolate business, during the third quarter we also wrote-off $14.4 million of goodwill that resulted from the SGM acquisition and was assigned to our existing China chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of Golden Monkey-branded product through its Tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. In light of the declining results in our China business and challenges impacting the overall retail landscape in Asia, we will continue to assess the impact of potential excess capacity on the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the Asia region. In June, we announced a new productivity initiative intended to simplify the organizational structure to enhance our ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer. In 2015, we incurred charges totaling $105.8 million, representing employee severance and related separation benefits, pension settlement charges, and incremental third-party costs related to the design and implementation of the new organizational structure. Excluding pension settlement charges, we currently estimate total pre-tax charges and costs for the program to be approximately $120 million, the majority of which are cash. The remaining costs for this program are expected to be incurred within the first three quarters of 2016. Giving consideration to the aforementioned impacts, our 2015 net sales decreased 0.5%, to $7,386.6 million in 2015 from $7,421.8 million in 2014, while our net income and earnings per share-diluted declined by 39.4% and 38.5%, respectively. Excluding a 1.6% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 1.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, our net income increased by 1.5%, driven by positive U.S. gross margin expansion, while our non-GAAP EPS also benefited from recent share buybacks, increasing a total of 3.5%. Entering 2016, we expect changing shopping habits in the U.S. and volatile international markets to remain a headwind. Despite these issues, we will continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets and build on the strategies we have established as they will benefit the company over the long term. We also plan to make incremental investments in our existing snacks platform to drive additional growth. These initiatives should enable us to achieve net sales and earnings growth. We expect to achieve long-term net sales growth of 3-5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and, given the scale advantages of our North America business and a balanced approach to international investments, we expect to generate long-term non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted growth of 6-8%. For 2016, we expect net sales growth of approximately 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which is estimated to be approximately 1.0% unfavorable. North America net sales are expected to be driven by confectionery and snacks growth, including Krave meat snacks distribution gains. We have many exciting new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category, including Reese’s Snack Mix and Hershey’s Snack Bites canisters, Cadbury chocolates in a stand-up pouch targeting the mass premium market and the introduction of Allan Candy sugar confectionery peg bag items and some other yet to be announced new candy and snacking products. We expect gross margin to approximate the 2015 level and are focused on managing non-essential selling, marketing and administrative as we continue to leverage existing resources. Additionally, implementation of the business productivity initiative announced in June is on track, and we will continue to invest in advertising and related consumer marketing, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication. As a result, we expect 2016 full-year reported earnings per share-diluted to improve significantly, on the basis of lower unusual charges, and adjusted earnings per share-diluted to increase approximately 6%, as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2016 that follows. Our 2016 outlook reflects information currently available to us; however, it is subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly pertaining to the macroeconomic uncertainties and evolving consumer dynamics in China. While further volatility could evolve in that market, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows or financial position. Net sales decreased 0.5% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting volume declines of 3.4% and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.6%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization of 3.5% as well as a 1.0% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures. The favorable net price realization, primarily in the U.S., was attributed to the price increase announced in mid-2014. The volume declines were attributed to volume elasticity relating to the pricing action in the U.S. as well as lower everyday product sales given the challenging shopper environment in North America, coupled with lower sales in China. Excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 1.1% in 2015. Net sales increased 3.9% in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting volume growth of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 0.2%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.7%. The volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our North America and International and Other segments, coupled with almost 1% of growth from the recent SGM acquisition. The pricing benefit from the 2014 mid-year price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with near-term volume elasticity related to the price increase. Consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. In 2015, the category and Hershey growth rates continue to be impacted by changing consumer shopping habits and increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, which has been driving broader snacking category growth in 2014 and 2015. Despite these market dynamics, for the full year 2015, our U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.4%, which was in line with category growth. Our market share decreased by 10 basis points; however, we maintained an industry leading 31.3% U.S. market share. Cost of sales decreased 2.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. Supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.6%. These declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs, and unfavorable sales mix, which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 4.1%. In addition, cost of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of $7.3 million, business realignment charges of $8.8 million and non-service related pension expense of $2.5 million, which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 0.5%. In comparison, cost of sales benefited by $1.1 million in 2014, primarily due to non-service related pension income. Gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. Favorable net price realization as well as supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points. However, these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable sales mix, which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges, 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis points. Cost of sales increased 5.7% in 2014 compared with 2013. Higher costs associated with sales volume increases, higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 7.8%. The higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs, which cannot be effectively hedged, while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes, which are typically at lower margins than non-seasonal products. These cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs, which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.1%. Gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013. Supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points. The impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points. However, these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expenses increased $70.9 million or 3.7% in 2015. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense increased 1.0% during this period. Excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 6.7% as compared to 2014, driven by incremental increases from acquired businesses. Excluding the impact of acquisition costs, SM&A expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued focus on non-essential spending. SM&A expenses in 2015 were also impacted by charges of $13.6 million attributed to the 2015 productivity initiative, acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million, non-service related pension expense of $15.6 million and other business realignment charges of $3.7 million. In 2014, SM&A expenses included acquisition and integration costs of $12.4 million, other business realignment charges of $2.9 million and non-service related pension expense of $0.9 million. SM&A expenses decreased $25.7 million or 1.3% in 2014. This includes a 3.1% reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas. Excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses, selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts, offset in part by higher employee-related costs, including additional headcount in our China business and additional focused selling resources, as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of SGM. Selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the $5.6 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in Johor, Malaysia.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2015-02-20.@ We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America and a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. As of December 31, 2014, we began reporting our operations through two segments: North America and International and Other. In 2014, we continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives: Our U.S. business increased its overall candy, mint and gum (“CMG”) market share to 31.4%, an increase of 0.3 share points versus 2013. We acquired Shanghai Golden Monkey, more than doubling our presence in China. We expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of Hershey’s Spreads and the related Snacksters Graham Dippers. We sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our goal of sourcing 100% certified cocoa by 2020. However, 2014 also presented some challenges. In our U.S. markets, we believe lower retail store traffic and changes in consumer spending patterns impacted how consumers shopped for snacks, while a number of our international markets continued to experience macroeconomic headwinds. Despite these challenges, our 2014 net sales and net income growth of 3.9% and 3.2%, respectively, reflects solid performance. For the full year 2014, our U.S. CMG retail takeaway increase of 2.7% was about one full percentage point greater than the category growth rate. However, throughout the year, retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular. Additionally, increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014, which we believe adversely impacted purchases of non-seasonal candy products. Our 2014 international net sales increased nearly 15%, including a 2.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and net sales contribution of approximately 7%, or $54 million, from Shanghai Golden Monkey Food Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (“SGM”). Excluding SGM and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, our international net sales increased approximately 10%. Our 2014 results were also impacted by increasing commodity and other input costs. In North America, we announced a weighted average price increase in July 2014 of approximately 8% across our instant consumable, multi-pack, packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs, including raw materials, packaging, fuel, utilities and transportation, which we expect to incur in the future. While the increase was effective immediately, direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following four-week period, and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until Halloween 2015. Therefore, this action did not materially benefit our 2014 results, but should be beneficial to our 2015 earnings. Entering 2015, we are focused on accelerating growth and we have a solid line-up of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category. In addition to the fourth quarter carryover benefit from Brookside Crunchy Clusters and Reese’s Spreads take home jar, we are also launching Kit Kat White Minis, Hershey’s Caramels, Ice Breakers Cool Blasts Chews, Reese’s Spreads Snacksters Graham Dippers and some other yet-to-be-announced new candy and snacking products. These launches will be supported with higher levels of advertising and in-store merchandising and programming that should enable us to mitigate the impact of volume elasticity related to the 2014 price increase and compete effectively across the CMG and broader snack categories. Additionally, we expect advertising, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication, to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth. We currently estimate full year 2015 net sales growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 2.5%. This reflects our expectation for continued macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and slowly improving U.S. non-seasonal trends. In addition, we now anticipate foreign currency exchange impacts to be greater than our previous estimate and to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on full year net sales growth. We continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin-enhancing opportunities in addition to normal productivity gains. With the conclusion of the Project Next Century (“PNC”) program, in 2015 we will begin to focus on the opportunities that exist for future incremental increases in productivity and costs savings. A portion of any potential savings from this assessment would be reinvested in initiatives to accelerate revenue growth. We continue to have good visibility into our cost structure, with the exception of dairy products which cannot be effectively hedged. We currently expect 2015 gross margin to increase approximately 135 to 145 basis points driven by the 2014 pricing action and productivity. Therefore, we expect 2015 growth in earnings per share-diluted in a range of 10% to 13%, including net dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share. We expect growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of 8% to 10%, as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2015 provided below. Net sales increased 3.9% in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting volume growth of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 0.2%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.7%. The volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our North America and International and Other segments, coupled with almost 1% of growth from the recent SGM acquisition. The pricing benefit from the mid-year price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with near-term volume elasticity related to the price increase. As discussed previously, we expect the 2014 pricing action to be more impactful to our 2015 results. Net sales increased 7.6% in 2013 compared with 2012, reflecting volume increases of 7.8% and nominal price realization of 0.1%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.3%. Higher sales of Brookside products contributed approximately 1.3% to the net sales increase. Consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. Hershey's Spreads, the jar and instant consumable pack types, is not captured in the U.S. CMG database referenced herein, as Nielsen captures this within grocery items. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. In 2014, the category and Hershey growth rates were below historical levels as retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular during the year. Additionally, increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014. Despite these market dynamics, for the full year 2014, our U.S. CMG retail takeaway increased 2.7%, which exceeded the category growth rate of 1.8%, and our market share increased by 30 basis points. Cost of sales increased 5.7% in 2014 compared with 2013. Higher costs associated with sales volume increases, higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 7.8%. The higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs, which cannot be effectively hedged, while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes, which are typically at lower margins than non-seasonal products. These cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs, which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.1%. Gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013. Supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points. The impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points. However, these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points. Cost of sales increased 2.1% in 2013 compared with 2012. The impact of sales volume increases and supply chain cost inflation together increased cost of sales by approximately 9.4%. Lower input costs, supply chain productivity improvements and a favorable sales mix reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.3%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $0.4 million were included in cost of sales in 2013, compared with $36.4 million in the prior year, benefiting 2013 cost of sales by 1.0%. Gross margin increased by 290 basis points in 2013 compared with 2012. Reduced input costs, supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower fixed costs as a percent of sales together improved gross margin by 390 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by supply chain cost inflation which reduced gross margin by 160 basis points. The impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited 2013 gross margin by 60 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expenses decreased $21.5 million or 1.1% in 2014. This includes a 3.1% reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas. Excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses, selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts, offset in part by higher employee-related costs, including additional headcount in our China business and additional focused selling resources, as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of SGM. Selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the $4.6 million gain recorded in the first quarter on the Lotte Shanghai Food Company (“LSFC”) acquisition and the $5.6 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in Johor, Malaysia. SM&A expenses increased $218.7 million or 12.8% in 2013. Contributing to the overall increase was a 19.7% increase in advertising, consumer promotions and other marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in the U.S. and international markets. Excluding the advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.8% primarily as a result of higher employee-related expenses, increased incentive compensation costs, legal fees and increased marketing research expenses, along with the write-off of certain assets associated with the remodeling of increased office space. There were minimal business realignment charges included in SM&A in 2013 compared with $2.5 million in 2012.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2014-02-21.@Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 were strong with increases in net sales, earnings per share and profitability despite continued macroeconomic challenges. Net sales increased 7.6% compared with 2012 due to sales volume increases in the United States and key international markets as we continued our focus on core brands and innovation. Advertising expense increased 21.3% for the year, supporting core brands along with new product launches. Net income and earnings per share-diluted also increased at greater rates than our long-term growth targets. The investments we have made in both productivity and cost savings resulted in a business model that is more efficient and effective, enabling us to deliver predictable, consistent and achievable marketplace and financial performance. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid. Our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes (“EBIT”), EBIT margin, Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock (“EPS”) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last four years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges. Non-service-related pension expenses also are excluded for each of the last four years, along with acquisition closing, integration and transaction costs, and a gain on the sale of certain non-core trademark licensing rights in 2011. Non-service-related pension expenses include interest costs, the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits. Non-service-related pension expenses may be very volatile from year-to-year as a result of changes in interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets. Therefore, we have excluded non-service-related pension expense from our results in accordance with GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial results excluding non-service-related pension expenses will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business. We believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year-to-year. Our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants after 2007, resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable. Net sales increased 7.6% in 2013 compared with 2012 due primarily to sales volume increases. Sales volume increases of 7.8% reflected core brand sales increases and incremental sales of new products in the U.S. and our international businesses. Higher sales of Brookside products contributed approximately 1.3% to the net sales increase. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.3%. Net sales in U.S. dollars for our businesses outside of the U.S. and Canada increased approximately 15.7% in 2013 compared with 2012, reflecting sales volume increases primarily in our focus markets of China, Mexico and Brazil. Net sales increases for our international businesses were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales increased 9.3% in 2012 compared with 2011 due to net price realization and sales volume increases in the U.S. and for our international businesses. Net price realization contributed approximately 5.7% to the net sales increase. Sales volume increased net sales by approximately 2.2% due primarily to sales of new products in the U.S. The Brookside acquisition contributed approximately 1.9% to the net sales increase. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.5%. Excluding incremental sales from the Brookside acquisition, net sales in the U.S. increased approximately 7.1% compared with 2011, primarily reflecting net price realization, along with sales volume increases from the introduction of new products. Net sales in U.S. dollars for our businesses outside of the U.S. increased approximately 9.1% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting sales volume increases and net price realization. Net sales increases for our international businesses were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Consumer takeaway and the change in market share for 2013 and 2012 are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. Consumer takeaway for 2011 is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share for 2011 is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of sales increased 2.1% in 2013 compared with 2012. The impact of sales volume increases and supply chain cost inflation together increased cost of sales by approximately 9.4%. Lower input costs, supply chain productivity improvements and a favorable sales mix reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.3%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $0.4 million were included in cost of sales in 2013, compared with $36.4 million in the prior year, reducing cost of sales by 1.0%. Gross margin increased by 2.9 percentage points in 2013 compared with 2012. Reduced input costs, supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower fixed costs as a percent of sales together improved gross margin by 3.9 percentage points. These improvements were partially offset by supply chain cost inflation which reduced gross margin by 1.6 percentage points. The impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2013 compared with 2012 increased gross margin by 0.6 percentage points. The cost of sales increase of 6.6% in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher input costs, the impact of sales volume increases and higher supply chain costs which together increased cost of sales by approximately 7.1%. The Brookside acquisition further increased cost of sales by approximately 2.0%. Supply chain productivity improvements reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.5%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $36.4 million were included in cost of sales in 2012, compared with $45.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily as a result of price realization and supply chain productivity improvements which together improved gross margin by 4.1 percentage points. These improvements were substantially offset by higher input and supply chain costs which reduced gross margin by a total of 2.9 percentage points. The impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 increased gross margin by 0.2 percentage points. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $218.7 million or 12.8% in 2013. Contributing to the overall increase was a 19.7% increase in advertising, consumer promotions and other marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in the U.S. and international markets. Advertising expenses increased 21.3% compared with 2012. Additionally, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.8% primarily as a result of higher employee-related expenses, increased incentive compensation costs, legal fees and increased marketing research expenses, along with the write-off of certain assets associated with the remodeling of increased office space. There were minimal business realignment charges included in SM&A in 2013 compared with $2.5 million in 2012. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $226.0 million or 15.3% in 2012. The increase was primarily a result of increased advertising, marketing research and consumer promotion expenses, higher employee-related expenses, increased incentive compensation costs and expenses associated with the Brookside acquisition. In addition, selling, marketing and administrative costs were reduced in 2011 by a $17.0 million gain on the sale of non-core trademark licensing rights. Advertising expense increased approximately 15.9% compared with 2011. Business realignment charges of $2.5 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2012 compared with $5.0 million in 2011. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Because actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in expectations or events or circumstances after the date this report. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. Our results for 2013 were strong, with solid financial and marketplace results. We have a solid position in the marketplace and we are responding to retail customer needs to drive overall category growth. We have consumer-driven initiatives planned for 2014 that we believe will continue to drive net sales growth across our businesses. We expect net sales growth of 5% to 7%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales increases are expected to be driven by core brand volume growth and innovation in the U.S. and international markets, complemented by in-store merchandising, programming and advertising. Net sales gains from innovation include the introduction of Hershey's Spreads, Lancaster Soft Crèmes Caramels and York Minis, in addition to the introduction of a Brookside instant consumable pack-type, Brookside Crunchy Clusters, Hershey's Kisses Deluxe in China and the continued rollout of our five global brands in key international markets. We expect innovation to contribute meaningfully to our net sales growth in 2014. Our international business is on track, and we expect net sales outside the U.S. and Canada to increase toward the top end of our 15% to 20% target, on a percentage basis versus 2013. We have good visibility into our cost structure, except for costs of dairy products which cannot be effectively hedged. We expect gross margin to increase in 2014, driven by productivity and cost savings initiatives, along with a favorable sales mix. We do not expect input cost deflation in 2014. Therefore, we expect 2014 gross margin on a reported basis to increase about 60 basis points, with expansion of adjusted gross margin expected to be around 50 basis points. As a result, we anticipate that earnings per share-diluted in accordance with GAAP will increase 11% to 14% in 2014 compared with 2013. Growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted is expected to be in the 9% to 11% range, as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted earnings per share-diluted projections provided below. Advertising and related consumer marketing is expected to increase mid to high single-digits, on a percentage basis versus last year. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, are expected to increase at a more modest rate in 2014 as we build on the investments in go-to-market capabilities established over the last few years, as well as consumer knowledge-based projects related to our Insights Driven Performance initiatives. In the Outlook above, we have provided income measures excluding certain items, in addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. In 2013, the Company recorded GAAP charges of $19.0 million, or $0.05 per share-diluted, attributable to the Next Century program. Non-service related pension expense of $10.9 million, or $0.03 per share-diluted, was recorded in 2013. In 2013, the Company recorded pre-tax acquisition costs of $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share-diluted, primarily related to the agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SGM. In 2014, the Company expects to record GAAP charges of about $7.0 million to $9.0 million, or $0.02 to $0.03 per share-diluted. Charges associated with the Next Century program are expected to be $0.01 to $0.02 per share-diluted. Acquisition closing, integration and transaction charges related to SGM are expected to be $0.02 to $0.03 per share-diluted. Non-service related pension income is expected to be approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share-diluted, in 2014.

Sales volume increased net sales by approximately 3.4% due primarily to sales of new products in the U.S. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by approximately 0.3%. Net sales in the U.S. increased approximately 5.9% compared with 2010, with essentially equal contribution from net price realization and sales volume gains. Net sales for our businesses outside of the U.S. increased approximately 14.5% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting sales volume increases and net price realization, particularly for our focus markets in Mexico, Brazil, China and India.

The cost of sales increase of 6.6% in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher input costs, the impact of sales volume increases and higher supply chain costs which together increased cost of sales by approximately 7.1%. An increase in cost of sales of 2.0% resulted from the Brookside acquisition. Supply chain productivity improvements reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.5%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $36.4 million were included in cost of sales in 2012, compared with $45.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily as a result of price realization and supply chain productivity improvements which together improved gross margin by 4.1 percentage points. These improvements were substantially offset by higher input and supply chain costs which reduced gross margin by a total of 2.9 percentage points. The impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 increased gross margin by 0.2 percentage points. The cost of sales increase of 9.0% in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily associated with higher sales volume and significantly higher commodity costs which together increased cost of sales by approximately 8.0%, each contributing about half of the increase. Increases in other supply chain costs were essentially offset by productivity improvements. Business realignment and impairment charges of $45.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2011, compared with $13.7 million in the prior year, contributing approximately 1.0% of the cost of sales increase. Gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage point in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher commodity and other supply chain costs reduced gross margin by about 3.2 percentage points, substantially offset by productivity improvements and price realization of approximately 2.8 percentage points. Supply chain productivity and net price realization each contributed approximately half of this gross margin improvement. The impact of higher business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2011 compared with 2010 reduced gross margin by 0.6 percentage points. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $226.0 million or 15.3% in 2012. The increase was primarily a result of increased advertising, marketing research and consumer promotion expenses, higher employee-related expenses, increased incentive compensation costs and expenses associated with the Brookside acquisition.

 .@0000047111.@HSY.@2012-02-17.@Results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were strong, reflecting our continued success in executing our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Net sales and earnings per share increased at rates exceeding our growth targets, even as the economic environment continued to be challenging. Our decision to invest in our business through cost savings initiatives, new product introductions and our consumer-driven approach to core brand investments contributed to our strong financial performance and improved market share in 2011. Net sales increased 7.2% compared with 2010 driven principally by net price realization and sales volume increases in the United States and international markets, as we continue to execute in the marketplace. Advertising expense increased approximately 5.9% versus 2010, with a continued focus on brand building and go-to-market strategies for the U.S. and key international markets.

Favorable price realization increased net sales by over 2%. Our international businesses contributed to sales growth during the year as a result of sales volume gains or, in certain markets, favorable price realization, partially offset by sales volume declines.

Gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage point in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher commodity and other supply chain costs reduced gross margin by about 3.2 percentage points, substantially offset by productivity improvements and price realization of approximately 2.8 percentage points. Supply chain productivity and net price realization each contributed approximately half of this gross margin improvement. The impact of higher business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2011 compared with 2010 reduced gross margin by 0.6 percentage points. The cost of sales increase of 0.3% was associated with sales volume increases, resulting in higher cost of sales of about 4%. Increased supply chain costs and slightly higher input costs also contributed to the cost of sales increase. These increases were substantially offset by cost decreases resulting from supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower product obsolescence costs, which reduced cost of sales by a total of approximately 4.5%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $13.7 million were included in cost of sales in 2010 compared with $10.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin improvement of 3.9 percentage points resulted from favorable price realization of about 2 percentage points, supply chain productivity improvements of approximately 2 percentage points and lower product obsolescence costs of approximately 1 percentage point. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher supply chain and input costs which reduced gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $51.3 million or 3.6% in 2011. The increase was primarily a result of higher marketing and employee-related expenses, offset somewhat by the $17.0 million gain on the sale of non-core trademark licensing rights as well as lower costs related to the consideration of potential acquisitions and divestitures in 2011. Advertising expense increased approximately 5.9% compared with 2010. Selling and administrative expenses increased approximately 6.6%, reflecting investments in enhancing and executing our global go-to-market strategies, including increases in selling, marketing and certain administrative staff levels. Business realignment charges of $5.0 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2011 compared with $1.5 million in 2010. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $217.8 million or 18.0% in 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising and other marketing expenses which increased a total of $171.1 million, or 41.0% versus 2009. Advertising expense increased 62.2% compared with 2009. An increase in other selling, marketing and administrative expenses was associated with higher selling expenses, increased legal costs and higher administrative expenses for our international businesses, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were offset somewhat by lower costs related to the consideration of potential acquisitions and divestitures in 2010. Business realignment charges of $1.5 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2010 compared with $6.1 million in 2009. In June 2010, we announced Project Next Century (the “Next Century program”) as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure. As part of the program, production will transition from the Company’s century-old facility at 19 East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey, Pennsylvania, to an expanded West Hershey facility, which was built in 1992. Production from the 19 East Chocolate Avenue plant, as well as a portion of the workforce, will be fully transitioned to the West Hershey facility primarily during the second quarter of 2012. We now estimate that the Next Century program will incur pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $150 million to $160 million. This estimate includes $130 million to $140 million in pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges and approximately $20 million in project implementation and start-up costs. Total costs of $43.4 million were recorded during 2011 and total costs of $53.9 million were recorded in 2010. In September 2011, we entered into a sale and leasing agreement for the 19 East Chocolate Avenue manufacturing facility with Chocolate Realty DST, a Delaware Statutory Trust. Chocolate Realty DST is not affiliated with the Milton Hershey School Trust. After manufacturing has fully transitioned to our West Hershey facility, we intend to continue leasing a portion of the building for administrative office space. As a result of our continuing involvement and use of the property, we are deemed to be the “owner” of the property for accounting purposes. We received net proceeds of $47.6 million and recorded a lease financing obligation of $50.0 million under the leasing agreement. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2041. During the second quarter of 2010 we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with Godrej Hershey Ltd. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $44.7 million, including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests. During 2009, we completed our comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program (the “global supply chain transformation program”). Manufacturing facilities in Naugatuck, Connecticut and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. The carrying value of these properties was $6.9 million as of December 31, 2011. The fair value of these properties was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Actual proceeds from the sale of these properties could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2012 or subsequent years. The charge of $39.3 million recorded in cost of sales during 2011 related primarily to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life associated with the Next Century program. A charge of $5.0 million was recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses during 2011 for project administration related to the Next Century program. Plant closure expenses of $8.6 million were recorded in 2011 primarily related to costs associated with the relocation of production lines. Employee separation costs were reduced by $9.5 million during 2011, which consisted of an $11.2 million credit reflecting lower expected costs related to voluntary and involuntary terminations at the two manufacturing facilities and a net benefits curtailment loss of $1.7 million also related to the employee terminations. The charge of $13.6 million recorded in cost of sales during 2010 related primarily to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life associated with the Next Century program. A charge of $1.5 million was recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses during 2010 for project administration. Fixed asset impairment charges of $5.5 million were recorded during 2010. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Employee separation costs of $33.2 million during 2010 were related to expected voluntary and involuntary terminations at the two manufacturing facilities.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2011-02-18.@Results for the year ended December 31, 2010 were strong, reflecting our continued focus on our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable long-term growth in the evolving marketplace. Net sales and earnings per share increased at rates exceeding our growth targets, even as the economic environment continued to be challenging. Our decision to invest in our business through cost savings initiatives, and our consumer-driven approach to core brand investments contributed to our strong financial performance and improved market share in 2010. Net sales increased 7.0% compared with 2009 driven primarily by volume gains both in the United States and international markets, as we continue to execute in the marketplace. Advertising expense increased over 60% versus 2009, with a continued focus on brand building and go-to-market strategies for the U.S. and key international markets. Net income and earnings per share-diluted also increased as the result of our investment initiatives. We generated strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid. Our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes (“EBIT”), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock (“EPS”) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last six years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges related to goodwill and certain trademarks. Net sales increased 7.0% due to sales volume increases of approximately 4%, primarily for core brands in the U.S. and sales of new products. Favorable price realization increased net sales by over 2%. Our international businesses contributed to sales growth during the year as a result of sales volume gains or, in certain markets, favorable price realization, partially offset by sales volume declines. Overall, sales volume increased for our international business compared with 2009. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by about 1%. The increase in net sales resulted from list price increases and reduced rates of promotional allowances that resulted in favorable price realization of approximately 10%. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of approximately 6% associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses in the United States. Net sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands, particularly Hershey’s, Reese’s, Twizzlers and Kit Kat, which benefited from our consumer-driven strategy, including advertising and in-store selling, merchandising and programming. Sales increases in local currency for our international businesses, particularly in Mexico, Canada, and Brazil, were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced total net sales by approximately 1.0%. The acquisition of Van Houten Singapore increased 2009 net sales by $12.0 million, or 0.2%. The cost of sales increase of 0.3% was associated with sales volume increases, resulting in higher cost of sales of about 4%. Increased supply chain costs and slightly higher input costs also contributed to the cost of sales increase. These increases were substantially offset by cost decreases resulting from supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower product obsolescence costs, which reduced cost of sales by a total of approximately 4.5%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $13.7 million were included in cost of sales in 2010 compared with $10.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin improvement of 3.9 percentage points resulted from favorable price realization of about 2 percentage points, supply chain productivity improvements of approximately 2 percentage points and lower product obsolescence costs of approximately 1 percentage point. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher supply chain and input costs which reduced gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. The decrease in cost of sales was caused by volume declines of approximately 6% resulting from price elasticity. Higher input costs resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately 4% as higher raw material and pension costs more than offset productivity gains and lower product obsolescence costs. During 2009, a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a $12.7 million cost of sales decrease. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease. Business realignment charges of $10.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with $77.8 million in the prior year which had the effect of reducing cost of sales by approximately 2%. Gross margin increased 4.5 percentage points. Favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improved gross margin by approximately 7 percentage points, while higher input costs and pension expense reduced gross margin by approximately 3 percentage points. Lower business realignment costs in 2009 increased gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $217.8 million or 18.0% in 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising and other marketing expenses which increased a total of $171.1 million, or 41.0% versus 2009. Advertising expense increased 62.2% compared with 2009. An increase in other selling, marketing and administrative expenses was associated with higher selling expenses, increased legal costs and higher administrative expenses for our international businesses, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were offset somewhat by lower costs related to the consideration of potential acquisitions and divestitures in 2010. Business realignment charges of $1.5 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2010 compared with $6.1 million in 2009. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense, and increases in administrative and selling costs, principally associated with higher pension and incentive compensation expenses. An increase in advertising expense of approximately 50% was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions. Costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses by approximately $11.0 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Business realignment and impairment charges of $6.1 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with $8.1 million in 2008. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. We expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2011. In this environment, we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumer-driven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in North America, along with investments in our strategic international businesses. We will continue to focus on our core brands and leverage the Company’s scale at retail during 2011. We exited 2010 with momentum and expect to build on our success in 2011 as we have a number of initiatives planned to drive growth across our markets, including the U.S. launch of Hershey’s Drops, Reese’s Minis and other new products. We will also continue the disciplined roll-out and distribution of the Hershey’s and Hershey’s Kisses brands in select key emerging markets where we are gaining consumer awareness and trial. In 2011, we expect advertising to increase in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, supporting new product launches and core brands in both the United States and international markets. We expect 2011 net sales growth to be around the top of our 3% to 5% long-term objective. Commodity markets remain volatile and we expect significantly higher input costs in 2011 compared with 2010. We have visibility into our cost structure for 2011; however, the risk of cost increases remains for certain inputs, such as dairy products, which we are not able to effectively hedge. We expect to substantially offset higher input costs in 2011 through productivity and cost savings initiatives which are in place and we estimate that 2011 adjusted gross margin will be about the same as in 2010. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth to be around the top of our long-term 6% to 8% objective.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2010-02-19.@Our results for the year ended December 31, 2009 demonstrated excellent progress in a difficult economic environment. We exceeded net sales targets, while implementing price increases and operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset significant increases in input and employee benefits costs. We have essentially completed the global supply chain transformation program and have achieved our objectives. We increased advertising investment in our core brands in North America and in certain of our key international markets, while also achieving strong growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted. We generated strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid. Net sales increased 3.2%, which was within our long-term growth target. The increase was driven by price realization, as sales volumes declined at less than expected rates due to pricing elasticity. Earnings per share growth exceeded our long-term objective and our North American market share increased during the year. Our financial results and marketplace performance for the year indicate that our consumer-driven approach to core brand investment along with necessary pricing actions enable us to continue to meet our long-term financial goals. Our efforts will remain focused toward implementing our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable long-term growth in the evolving marketplace. Our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases and a reduction in promotional allowances, offset by sales volume decreases, primarily in the United States. Sales volume decreases were associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses. Sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands, particularly Hershey’s, Reese’s, Twizzlers and Kit Kat, which benefited from our consumer-driven strategy, including advertising and in-store selling, merchandising and programming.

The acquisition of Van Houten Singapore increased 2009 net sales by $12.0 million, or 0.2%. The increase in net sales was attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases, substantially offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the United States. Increased sales in the United States were primarily attributable to our core brands, particularly Hershey’s and Reese’s, and incremental sales of new products, primarily Hershey’s Bliss. Sales volume increases from our international businesses, particularly in India, China and the Philippines, also contributed to the sales increase, although were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales for our Godrej Hershey Ltd. business increased $37.2 million, or 0.8%, in 2008 reflecting incremental sales for the full-year compared with results for 2007 which included only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The cost of sales decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to sales volume decreases, favorable supply chain productivity and lower product obsolescence costs, offset substantially by higher input costs, particularly for raw materials and pension expense. During 2009, a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a $12.7 million cost of sales decrease. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease. Business realignment charges of $10.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with $77.8 million in the prior year. The gross margin improvement resulted primarily from favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, offset partially by increased input costs and pension expense. Approximately 1.4 percentage points of the gross margin increase was attributable to the impact of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2009 compared with 2008. The cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs, and the full-year cost of sales for Godrej Hershey Ltd. which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. These cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases. Business realignment charges of $77.8 million were included in cost of sales in 2008, compared with $123.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007, with approximately three-quarters of the increase attributable to lower business realignment charges in 2008. Favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase, but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense, and increases in administrative and selling costs, principally associated with higher pension and incentive compensation expenses. An increase in advertising expense of approximately 50% was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions. Costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses by approximately $11.0 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Expenses of $6.1 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with $8.1 million in 2008. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employee-related expenses, including higher incentive compensation expense, increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the United States and expansion of our international businesses. Higher advertising, marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase. Business realignment charges of $8.1 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with $12.6 million in 2007. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. We expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2010. In this environment, we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumer-driven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in North America, along with investments in our strategic international businesses. We expect to increase advertising investment by 25% to 30% behind our core brands and new product introductions. We will also continue to invest in consumer insights, in-store selling, merchandising and programming to drive profitable growth for both our Company and our customers. We expect our cost structure to remain at elevated levels in 2010. Key commodity markets remain volatile and prices for many commodities are near multi-year highs. We have good visibility into our full-year cost structure for 2010. We also expect to continue to achieve productivity and efficiency improvements, along with price realization in 2010, resulting in modestly enhanced margins. For 2010, we expect to achieve net sales growth within our long-term objective of 3% to 5% and adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth within our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2009-02-20.@Our results for the year ended December 31, 2008 were in line with our expectations and reflect the progress we are making toward implementing our major strategic initiatives. Net sales grew at an annual rate of 3.8%. Marketplace performance improved in response to our continued investment in our core brands. We are investing to strengthen our position in the chocolate and confectionery markets in which we compete and build on our marketplace results. The net sales increase was driven by favorable price realization, improved U.S. marketplace performance for our products, and sales gains from our international businesses, offset somewhat by reduced sales volume in the United States. Incremental sales from the full-year results of Godrej Hershey Ltd. also contributed to the net sales increase, as results for 2007 only included the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. Net income and earnings per share-diluted increased substantially compared with 2007 due to lower costs resulting from our business realignment initiatives.

Net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006. Sales increased for our international businesses, primarily exports to Asia and Latin America, as well as sales in Canada and Mexico. The acquisition of Godrej Hershey Ltd. increased net sales by $46.5 million, or 0.9%, in 2007. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales. These increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the U.S., reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slow-moving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the U.S. Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs, and the full-year cost of sales for Godrej Hershey Ltd. which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. These cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases. Business realignment charges of $77.8 million were included in cost of sales in 2008, compared with $123.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007. Favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase, but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs. Business realignment charges of $123.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2007, compared with a credit of $3.2 million included in cost of sales in 2006. The remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs, particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and the Godrej Hershey Ltd. business acquired in May 2007, offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006, resulting in a reduction of 2.6 percentage points. The rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials, offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employee-related expenses, including higher incentive compensation expense, increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the United States and expansion of our international businesses. Higher advertising, marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase. Expenses of $8.1 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with $12.6 million in 2007. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses. Project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed $12.6 million to the increase. Higher administrative costs were principally associated with employee-related expenses from the expansion of our international businesses, including the impact of the acquisition of Godrej Hershey Ltd. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. During 2008, we announced a new consumer-driven business model with a comprehensive approach intended to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years. Our financial targets include long-term consolidated net sales growth in the three to five percent range and increases in earnings per share-diluted, excluding items affecting comparability, at an annual rate of six to eight percent. Items affecting comparability include business realignment and impairment charges and credits, gains or losses on the sale of certain businesses, and certain other items. Our net sales growth will primarily leverage our core portfolio of brands in the United States. We expect to improve our price-value equation through package and product upgrades and merchandising innovation resulting in increased price realization. We also expect growth from our international businesses primarily in faster-growing emerging markets. For 2009, we expect net sales growth of two to three percent from our pricing actions and core brand sales growth. We expect unit sales volume to decline in the United States due to the elasticity effects of price increases implemented during 2008 which will result in higher everyday and promoted prices for consumers. The impact of the declines in unit sales volume is expected to be more than offset by price realization. We expect growth in net sales for our international business at rates greater than in the United States, offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Considering the significant increases in raw material prices and other input costs and the extreme volatility in market prices, we expect substantial cost increases in 2009. While commodity spot prices have moderated somewhat, we expect costs for our key inputs to remain volatile and above historical averages on a spot basis. We now expect our commodity cost basket to increase by approximately $175 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The financial market and credit crisis have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity to-date. However, the extraordinary decline in the financial markets in 2008 significantly reduced the fair value of our pension plan assets which is expected to result in an increase in 2009 pension expense of approximately $70 million. Despite these increases we plan to continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets to build on our momentum. Specifically, advertising expense is expected to increase by $30 million to $35 million in 2009. These cost increases will be more than offset by higher net pricing, savings from the global supply chain transformation program and on-going operating productivity improvement. Earnings per share-diluted, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to increase in 2009, however, due to the significant commodity and pension cost increases, higher levels of core brand investment spending and current macroeconomic conditions, we expect growth to be at a rate below our long-term objective of six to eight percent. For 2009, we expect total pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program, including the increase in the scope of the program, to be in the range of $45 million to $70 million, excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges discussed below. Total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2009 are expected to reduce earnings per share-diluted by $0.13 to $0.20. We expect total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs for the global supply chain transformation program to be at the upper end of the $575 million to $600 million range. This includes pension settlement charges recorded in 2007 and 2008 as required in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits (as amended) (“SFAS No. 88”). Pension settlement charges are non-cash charges for the Company. Such charges accelerate the recognition of pension expenses related to actuarial gains and losses resulting from interest rate changes and differences in actual versus assumed returns on pension assets. The Company normally amortizes actuarial gains and losses over a period of about 13 years. The global supply chain transformation program charges recorded in 2007 and in 2008 have included pension settlement charges of approximately $24.6 million as employees leaving the Company under the program have been withdrawing lump sums from the defined benefit pension plans. These charges are included in the current global supply chain transformation program estimates of $575 million to $600 million. In addition to the settlement charges reflected above, additional SFAS No. 88 pension settlement charges of up to $65 million may be incurred depending on decisions of impacted hourly employees to withdraw funds during 2009 and 2010. The amount of the potential charges has increased significantly as a result of the recent declines in the financial markets. The likely range of possible additional charges for 2009` is zero to $50 million. There would be no charge if withdrawals by hourly employees are below the SFAS No. 88 settlement threshold level and $50 million, based on current market conditions, if they are above the threshold level.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2008-02-19.@The year ended December 31, 2007 was very difficult. We experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities, particularly costs for dairy products. These cost increases totaled approximately $100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points. We also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade-up product segments that affected our growth and profitability. In the face of these challenges, we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core U.S. market. Additionally, we continued to invest in key international markets. Net sales were even with the prior year as increased sales from our international businesses and incremental sales from the acquisition of the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company were substantially offset by lower sales in the United States. Net sales declined in the United States primarily as a result of increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Income and earnings per share were significantly lower than 2006 primarily as a result of a lower gross margin reflecting substantially higher input costs, principally related to higher costs for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and reduced price realization resulting from increased promotional costs, partly offset by lower costs associated with our supply chain productivity improvements. Increased investment spending for advertising and expansion of our international infrastructure also contributed to the lower income in 2007. Our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes (“EBIT”), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock (“EPS”) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. Net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006. Sales increased for our international businesses, primarily exports to Asia and Latin America, as well as sales in Canada and Mexico. The acquisition of Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company increased net sales by $46.5 million, or 0.9%, in 2007. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales. These increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the U.S., reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slow-moving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the U.S. U.S. confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales. Sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase. Sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the United States implemented in 2005, substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in Mexico also contributed to the sales increase. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in Canada, partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier. Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Business realignment charges of $123.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2007, compared with a credit of $3.2 million included in cost of sales in 2006. The remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs, particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and the Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages business acquired in May 2007, offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006, resulting in a reduction of 2.6 percentage points. The rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials, offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs. The sales volume increase, higher energy, raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006. Higher costs associated with obsolete, aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset somewhat by reductions in U.S. manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of $3.2 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives. Business realignment charges of $22.5 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials, increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix. These were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity. Our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 0.1 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 0.4 percentage points in 2005. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses. Project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed $12.6 million to the increase. Higher administrative costs were principally associated with employee-related expenses from the expansion of our international businesses, including the impact of the acquisition of Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives. Reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 9 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. The year ended December 31, 2007 was very difficult. We experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities, particularly costs for dairy products. These cost increases totaled approximately $100 million and reduced gross margin by approximately 240 basis points. We also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade-up product segments that affected our growth and profitability. In the face of these challenges, we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core U.S. market. Additionally, we continued to invest in key international markets. We expect this environment to continue into 2008 with continued increases in input costs versus 2007 of approximately $100 million, reducing gross margin by 200 basis points in 2008. We will also incur higher costs for increased investment in brand support and selling capabilities in the U.S., while we are taking steps to enhance product innovation across our portfolio. We will also be continuing to invest in key international markets, particularly China and India. To offset higher input costs, we are implementing aggressive productivity and cost savings initiatives in addition to those already underway as part of our global supply chain transformation program. We are also pursuing opportunities to improve price realization, including list price increases effective in January 2008. However, these pricing actions will only partly offset input cost increases and expenses associated with investment spending plans, resulting in lower EBIT and EPS, excluding items affecting comparability. We expect consolidated net sales to grow 3% to 4% in 2008. Our primary goal is to stabilize business performance in the United States. We will continue to emphasize our iconic brands, particularly Reese’s, Hershey’s and Kisses. We will also introduce Hershey’s Bliss™, Signatures packaged candy and Starbucks® branded chocolates to more fully participate in the rapidly growing premium and trade-up segments of the chocolate category. We will also have the full-year benefit of increased levels of retail coverage and increased investment in brand support. For the remainder of the Americas, we expect increases in net sales and profitability from Canada and Mexico, offset somewhat in Brazil as we restructure our business. Global growth is a key component of our future. We plan continued focus on growth in Asia, particularly China and India. We expect Godrej Hershey Foods and Beverages Company to have a positive impact on net sales for 2008 as we geographically expand the sugar confectionery business and introduce milk mix products. We anticipate net sales increases in China as the product line we introduced in 2007 gains distribution and consumer trial. We also anticipate the opening of Hershey’s Shanghai Chocolate World prior to the 2008 Olympics to gain additional exposure for our brands. For 2008, we expect total pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program and restructuring our business in Brazil to be in the range of $140 to $160 million. We expect costs of approximately $85 million to be included in cost of sales, primarily for accelerated depreciation, and approximately $20 million to be included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses for start up costs and program management. The remainder of these costs will be included in business realignment and impairment charges. Total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2008 are expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.37 to $0.42. As a result of higher input costs and increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising, along with investment in our international businesses, we expect EBIT to decrease in 2008, excluding the impact of business realignment and impairment charges. We expect EBIT margin to decline due to investments in advertising, selling capabilities and building infrastructure for our international businesses. Business realignment and impairment charges associated with our global supply chain transformation program and the restructuring of our business in Brazil will reduce net income and earnings per share in 2008. Excluding the impact of these business realignment initiatives, net income is expected to decline reflecting the increased investments in our businesses. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be within the $1.85 to $1.90 range for 2008. We believe that the disclosure of non-GAAP expected EPS-diluted excluding items affecting comparability provides investors with a better comparison of expected year-to-year operating results. A reconciliation of certain historical results presented in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20, along with the reasons why we believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors. We anticipate cash flows from operating activities in 2008 to be strong, but below 2007 levels as a result of reduced working capital improvements compared with 2007 and increased cash required for our global supply chain transformation program. We expect working capital to improve in 2008, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the second half of the year, but not at the levels experienced in 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. For 2008, we expect total capital additions to be in the range of $300 to $325 million, with $150 to $170 million associated with our global supply chain transformation program.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2007-02-23.@We concluded a difficult year in 2006. Following a strong first half, we experienced a slow-down in retail performance resulting from a shift from limited edition line extensions to more sustainable new product platforms which took longer than expected. In addition, our base business sales were negatively impacted in the second half of the year by poor merchandising activity. Results for 2006, excluding items affecting comparability as indicated below, fell short of our long-term goals and were below expectations. Net sales were impacted by slower retail takeaway and a decline in market share during the second half of the year, primarily in our North American chocolate business. Income per share-diluted was impacted by the lower than expected sales growth, increased costs for product obsolescence associated with the shift to new product platforms and increased expenses for advertising and consumer programs during the fourth quarter to regain marketplace momentum. A product recall and temporary plant closure in Canada also negatively impacted our results for the year. We plan to accelerate growth in 2007 by focusing on increasing sales of our core confectionery products, revitalizing our iconic brands through increased advertising and increased consumer and customer support, and by expanding our innovative new product platforms based on consumer preferences. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (“SAB No. 108”), required companies to change the accounting principle used for evaluating the effect of possible prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. As a result, we changed one of the five criteria of our revenue recognition policy to delay the recognition of revenue on goods in-transit until they are received by our customers. We also made adjustments to correct certain liabilities as of December 31, 2006, along with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings for all years presented in this report. Adjustments were made to liabilities primarily associated with business acquisitions and divestitures occurring prior to 2002. As permitted by SAB No. 108, we adjusted our financial statements for all prior periods to provide comparability. These adjustments were not material to our results of operations or financial condition in any period presented in this report. Our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures.

We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2006, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the business realignment initiatives and Note 11 contains information about the income tax provision adjustment.  U.S. confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales. Sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase. Sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the United States implemented in 2005, substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in Mexico also contributed to the sales increase. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in Canada, partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier. Business acquisitions, primarily Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation (“Mauna Loa”) and Grupo Lorena, contributed approximately 2.9% of the increase in net sales from 2004. Approximately two-thirds of the additional sales increase of 6.2% resulted from unit volume growth, primarily reflecting the introduction of new products and limited edition items. Improved performance by our Canadian and Mexican businesses and exports to Asia and Latin America also contributed to this increase. The remaining sales increase resulted from selling price increases, a lower rate of promotional spending, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international businesses. Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for measured channels which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The sales volume increase, higher energy, raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006. Higher costs associated with obsolete, aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset somewhat by reductions in U.S. manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of $3.2 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives. Business realignment charges of $22.5 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials, increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix. These were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity. Our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 0.1 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 0.4 percentage points in 2005. Business realignment charges increased cost of sales by $22.5 million. Higher sales volume, business acquisitions and higher raw material costs, in addition to higher labor, overhead and distribution costs primarily caused the remainder of the increase. A less favorable product mix, primarily associated with the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, and the impact of business realignment charges reduced our gross margin by 1.1 percentage points. Improved price realization, primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for our international businesses, more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs, and sales of certain new products which had lower margins. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives. Reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased during this period primarily due to increased performance-based employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation. Business acquisition expenses and consumer promotions expenses also increased, but were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors on page 8 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, we have improved operating results as we implemented our business strategies. Over the long-term, our strategies seek to achieve the following goals, excluding items affecting comparability: Net sales growth of 3% – 4% per year; Annual growth in EBIT of 7% – 9%; Improvement in EBIT margin of 70 – 90 basis points per year; and EPS growth of 9% – 11% per year. Our focus in 2007 includes enhancing the relevance of our products, extending our reach and enabling our growth. Key priorities include the following: Accelerating core brand growth; Investing in innovative new product platforms; Refocusing snack adjacencies; Disciplined global expansion; and Providing affordability by expanding gross margin. We expect sales growth in 2007 to be within our long-term goal of 3% to 4%. Our top priority is restoring and accelerating core brand growth, with renewed emphasis on our iconic brands, particularly Kisses, Hershey’s and Reese’s. Investment in these brands will double in 2007 with enhanced advertising, increased consumer support and powerful in-store merchandising. Emphasis during 2007 will also be focused on on-trend growth platforms that leverage our iconic brands, our confectionery and nut expertise and our marketplace scale. The primary growth platforms that we will focus on in 2007 are: Dark and premium chocolate; Refreshment products; Health and wellness products; and Substantial snacks. Growth in the dark and premium chocolate platform will be driven by the Cacao Reserve by Hershey’s product line introduced in 2006, sales growth for Hershey’s Extra Dark and Special Dark products, and expansion of sales of Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt dark and premium chocolates. Increases in sales of refreshment products are expected from Ice Breakers gum and mint items, driven by the introduction of new gum and mint sours products. York chocolate-covered chewy mints, introduced in late 2006, will also contribute to sales increases in 2007. Increased sales for our health and wellness product platform will be generated by sixty calorie and one hundred calorie portion control products that leverage our scale brands, along with incremental sales of the Dagoba organic chocolates business acquired in late 2006. Growth will also be contributed from the introduction of Ice Breakers mint and gum products that contain Vitamin C, ginseng and antioxidants. Growth in the substantial snack platform is anticipated from sales of new layered sandwich cookies, single-serve soft cookies and brownies primarily under the Hershey’s and Reese’s brand names. Sales increases are also expected from our Really Nuts product line in 2007. Over time, we will focus on disciplined global expansion in selected high potential markets with a regionally relevant product portfolio. Geographically, we expect future net sales growth to be concentrated primarily in emerging markets in Asia, particularly India and China, Mexico and selected markets in South America. We intend to focus on growth from our large-scale brands, expand our sales to global customers and develop region-specific business systems and alliances. We expect a return to gross margin expansion in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. We expect higher input costs in 2007, compared with 2006, although to a lesser extent than the cost increases in 2006 compared with 2005. The amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs that we have not fully hedged. We utilize forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintain a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies. We expect to offset these cost increases through a combination of the following: Improved sales mix from higher margin single serve products and new product platforms; Reduced costs for product obsolescence; Effective procurement strategies; Continued improvements in supply chain productivity; and Cost control initiatives. EBIT is expected to grow 3% to 4% in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. Net sales growth and gross margin expansion will be substantially offset by increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising, along with investment in our international businesses. EBIT margin is expected to be flat in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. EBIT margin is affected by the following factors: Selling prices; Promotional allowances; Raw material and other input costs; Supply chain efficiencies; The mix of products sold in any period; Investment in advertising and consumer marketing programs; and Improvement in gross margin resulting from a more profitable sales mix and continued enhancement of supply chain productivity is expected to be offset by increased brand investment and the impact of our expanded international operations. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of sales during 2007. This is expected to result from increased advertising and consumer marketing expenses, and improvements in retail coverage and technology, along with the restoration of certain administrative expenses that were unusually low during 2006 because of our business realignment initiatives and lower than expected performance. Net income and EPS in 2006 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives. Excluding the impact of business realignment initiatives, net income is expected to increase 3% to 4% and EPS is expected to increase within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2007, reflecting the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases. We expect strong cash flows from operating activities in 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. We will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2006. We do not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2007. We will continue to repurchase shares of our Common Stock during 2007 under the $250 million share repurchase program approved in December 2006.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2006-02-28.@The Company concluded a strong year in 2005. Operating results were consistent with management’s strategies to profitably grow net sales and carefully control selling, marketing and administrative costs, resulting in balanced, consistent growth in earnings, excluding certain items affecting comparability discussed below. Gross margin was lower in 2005, primarily due to business realignment charges (further discussed in Note 4) and the full-year impact of the acquired Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. The Company gained market share in key classes of trade, introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities and offset continued increases in the cost of major raw materials, energy, employee benefits and compensation. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the result was record sales, profits and earnings per share for the year. The Company’s long-term goals include increasing net sales 3%–4% per year, increasing earnings before interest and income taxes (“EBIT”) 7%–9% per year, and increasing earnings per share (“EPS”) 9%–11% per year. These goals are intended to achieve balanced, sustainable growth over time. After excluding items affecting comparability, the Company exceeded all of these goals in 2005. The Company’s strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands, such as Hershey’s, Reese’s and Hershey’s Kisses, together with focused promotion and merchandising activities of new and existing products. During 2005, sales gains included recent product introductions such as Hershey’s Kisses filled with peanut butter, Hershey’s Kissables brand chocolate candies, Hershey’s cookies, Reese’s Big Cup peanut butter cups, Ice Breakers sour mints and Hershey’s Take5 candy bar, along with continued growth in all major trade channels. The trends of key marketplace metrics, such as retail takeaway and market share, continue to show positive results. During 2005, the Company achieved gains in retail takeaway and market share and strengthened its position in the U.S. confectionery market. In channels of distribution including sales in the food, drug and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., U.S. consumer takeaway in 2005 increased by 3.5% resulting in a market share gain of 0.9 points. Net sales increased approximately 9.2% in 2005, compared with 2004 net sales, which were approximately 6.2% above 2003. The increase in 2005, and over the three-year period, primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items, along with the impact of price increases, business acquisitions, improved exchange rates on international sales and improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales. Gross margin decreased from 39.5% in 2004 to 38.7% in 2005. The margin decline resulted primarily from a less favorable product mix, primarily associated with the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced gross margin by a total of 1.1 percentage points. Improved price realization, primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for the Company’s international businesses, more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins. The Company’s strategy to expand EBIT margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs, improving efficiencies in its supply chain and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. The Company has also implemented selected price increases and product weight reductions to help offset increases in raw material and other costs. EBIT margin decreased from 19.9% in 2004 to 17.8% in 2005. The EBIT margin decline resulted primarily from a lower gross margin resulting from the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges which reduced EBIT margin by a total of 3.1 percentage points. This decrease was partially offset by an improvement in EBIT margin of 1.0 percentage points resulting from improved price realization, improved profitability for the Company’s international businesses and lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins. Net income was $493.2 million in 2005 compared with $577.9 million in 2004. Net income per share-diluted of $1.99 for 2005, was down 11.6% from $2.25 per share for 2004. Net income and net income per share-diluted for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by the business realignment initiatives discussed below. Net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by a $61.1 million adjustment to Federal and state income tax contingency reserves, as discussed below. Net income was $577.9 million in 2004 compared with $441.9 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.25 for 2004, was up 34.7% from $1.67 per share for 2003. This gain resulted from increased income from operations, the non-recurring adjustment to the 2004 provision for income taxes, the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes recorded in 2003 associated with a change in accounting for the Company’s leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services. It also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services. For public entities, the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments, including employee stock options, would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of those instruments. That cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (often the vesting period). Generally, no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 and applied the modified retrospective application method to all prior years for which Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 was effective. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted, modified or settled in cash subsequent to December 31, 1994. Additional stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R reduced net income by $21.7 million, $13.0 million and $15.6 million, or $.09, $.05 and $.06 per share-diluted, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The additional expense for 2005 included $2.4 million after tax, or $.01 per share-diluted, in business realignment charges. The table below presents various items affecting the comparability of income over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. All income and income per share amounts reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Items affecting comparability include the impact of business realignment initiatives in 2005 and 2003, a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves, and a gain on the sale of business in 2003. The Company believes the presentation of income excluding such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations which are indicative of its ongoing operations. The Company excludes such items in evaluating key measures of performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on its business. The Company believes that this presentation provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of the business. Financial results including the impact of the reduction to the provision for income taxes, business realignment initiatives and the gain on the sale of business, over the three-year period may be insufficient in facilitating a complete understanding of the business as a whole and ascertaining the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. Income per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 13.4% in 2005 and 16.2% in 2004, reflecting the impact of the Company’s increased sales, control of selling, marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the periods. This performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period, as discussed under the heading Return Measures on page 36. During 2006, the Company expects sales growth to be somewhat above its long-term 3%–4% goal. The Company anticipates higher input costs in 2006, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. The Company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization, procurement strategies, continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT is expected to increase slightly above the long-term goal of 7%–9% in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability, and EBIT margin is expected to increase approximately 90 basis points. The Company expects to achieve 2006 growth in earnings per share-diluted slightly greater than its long-term goal of 9%–11%, excluding items affecting comparability. This growth will result from the sales and EBIT margin increases discussed above, combined with the realized annual savings from business realignment initiatives, continued control of selling, marketing, and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from continued share repurchases. The Company’s cash flow from operations is expected to increase in 2006 primarily as a result of reduced contributions to the Company’s pension plans and lower working capital requirements. Primary challenges in 2006 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the U.S. core confectionery category, the broader U.S. snack market and in selected international markets. Focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels, as well as on key global customers in selected regions of the world. The achievement of the Company’s objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and customer consolidation, along with social issues such as obesity concerns. In 2006, the Company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients, transportation and employee benefits. Successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the Company’s achievement of its financial objectives. Net sales for 2005 increased $406.7 million, or 9.2%, from 2004. Business acquisitions contributed approximately 2.9% of the increase from 2004. Approximately two-thirds of the additional sales increase of 6.3% resulted from unit volume growth, primarily reflecting the introduction of new products and limited edition items, and improved performance by the Company’s international businesses, particularly the Canadian, Mexican and export businesses in Asia and Latin America. The remainder of the sales increase resulted from selling price increases, a lower rate of promotional spending and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for the Company’s international businesses. Net sales increased $256.7 million, or 6.2%, from 2003 to 2004. Net sales were favorably impacted by increased sales volume, especially within the United States, primarily driven by the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items. Net sales of the Company’s Canadian, Mexican and Brazilian businesses also improved as a result of higher sales volume. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also resulted in increased sales for the Company’s international businesses, particularly in Canada. The positive impact of increased sales volume contributed more than 75% of the consolidated net sales growth. Higher selling prices, a more efficient rate of promotional spending and the acquisition of the Grupo Lorena business in Mexico also contributed to the net sales increase. Sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of certain gum brands in September 2003, decreased sales of remaining gum brands, and higher returns, discounts and allowances, relating primarily to the sales volume growth, along with lower export sales in Asia, particularly in China and Taiwan. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors on page 7 for information concerning the key risks to achieving future performance goals. During the three years ended December 31, 2005, the Company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies. Over the long-term these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3%–4% per year, 7%–9% annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes (“EBIT”), improvement in EBIT margin of 90 basis points per year, and 9%–11% earnings per share-diluted (“EPS”) growth per year. The Company expects sales growth in 2006 from benefit-driven innovation, such as the introduction of limited edition items and new products, continued expansion within the total U.S. snack market and a disciplined approach to achieving profitable growth in key global markets. The Company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions. During 2006 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2005: Hershey’s Kisses brand filled with peanut butter, Ice Breakers sour mints, Hershey’s Kissables brand chocolate candies and Hershey’s caramel bar. The Company expects year-over-year net sales growth to build throughout 2006 due to the timing of new product shipments, price increases, and shifts in seasonal business early in 2005. Overall growth for the full year 2006 is expected to be somewhat above the Company’s 3%–4% long-term goal. Geographically, net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in the Americas and selected regions in Asia. The Company intends to focus on growth from its large-scale brands, expand its sales to global customers and develop region-specific business systems. The Company expects higher input costs in 2006, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. The amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs which the Company has not fully hedged. The Company utilizes forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintains a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies. The Company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization, enhanced trade promotion efficiency, procurement strategies, continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT is expected to grow slightly above the long-term goal of 7%–9% in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability, as a result of net sales growth and gross margin expansion, combined with savings realized from the Company’s business realignment initiatives, along with careful control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT margin is expected to improve by approximately 90 basis points in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability. Margin improvement is affected by various factors, including selling prices, promotional allowances, raw material costs, supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. During 2006, EBIT margin expansion is expected from improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes and from increased sales to more profitable channels, such as convenience stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores and specialty stores. In addition, enhanced effectiveness in trade promotion spending focused on fewer brands with greater reach and reduced selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to contribute to margin expansion in 2006. Gross margin is expected to increase modestly in 2006 from improved price realization and supply chain efficiencies as the Company continues to leverage its existing manufacturing capacity and distribution infrastructure. A reduction in selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is anticipated from leveraging the Company’s sales force capabilities without increasing costs and from combining various administrative functions in the Company’s North American operations. These initiatives are expected to more than offset the impact of higher input costs, primarily for raw materials, transportation and employee benefits. Net income and EPS in 2005 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives recorded in the third and fourth quarters. Excluding the impact of the 2005 business realignment initiatives, net income and EPS are expected to increase slightly above the range of the Company’s long-term goals for the full year 2006. The Company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2006. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. The Company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2005. The Company does not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2006. The Company plans to repurchase approximately $575 million of its common stock in 2006 to be funded by cash provided from operations and additional borrowings.
.@0000047111.@HSY.@2005-03-07.@The Company concluded a strong year in 2004. Operating results were consistent with management’s strategies to profitably grow net sales, improve gross margin and carefully control selling, marketing and administrative costs, resulting in balanced, consistent growth in earnings. The Company gained market share in key classes of trade, introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities, offset substantial increases in the cost of major raw materials, primarily cocoa and dairy products, and executed a $500 million share purchase from its major shareholder. The result was record sales, profits and earnings per share for the year. The Company’s long-term goals include increasing net sales 3%–4% per year, increasing gross margin 70–90 basis points per year, increasing earnings before interest and income taxes 7%–9% per year and to increase earnings per share 9%–11% per year. These goals are intended to achieve balanced, sustainable growth over time. In 2004, the Company exceeded all of these goals, except gross margin expansion which was up 50 basis points, slightly less than the long-term goal. The Company’s strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands, such as Hershey’s, Reese’s and Hershey’s Kisses. During 2004, sales gains included product introductions such as Hershey’s Kisses filled with caramel, Swoops candies, Reese’s white chocolate peanut butter cups, Ice Breakers Liquid Ice mints, Hershey’s 1Gram Sugar Carb bar, and Hershey’s Take5 candy bar. The trends of key operating drivers, such as market share, are expected to continue to show positive results. During 2004, the Company achieved gains in market share each quarter and strengthened its confectionery category leadership position. Market share in measured channels increased 1.1 share points in the fourth quarter and .6 share points for the year. Measured channels include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Net sales increased approximately 6% in 2004, compared with 2003 net sales, which were approximately 1% above 2002. The increase in 2004, and over the three-year period, primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items, along with the impact of price increases, improved exchange rates on Canadian sales and, in 2004, improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales. The Company’s strategy to expand gross margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs and improving efficiencies in its supply chain. The Company has also implemented selected price increases and weight decreases to help offset increases in raw material costs, particularly for cocoa and dairy products. Gross margin increased to 39.5% in 2004 compared with 39.0% in 2003 and 37.8% in 2002. The improvements in gross margin resulted from price increases, selected weight reductions and improved supply chain efficiency over the three-year period, more than offsetting higher raw material costs. Net income was $590.9 million in 2004 compared with $457.6 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.30 for 2004, was up 33% from $1.73 per share for 2003. This gain resulted from increased income from operations, a non-recurring adjustment to the 2004 provision for income taxes, the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes recorded in 2003 associated with a change in accounting for the Company’s leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. Net income and income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for 2004 was favorably impacted by a $61.1 million adjustment to Federal and state income tax contingency reserves, as discussed below. Net income was $457.6 million in 2003, which included total net business realignment charges of $15.5 million after tax, an after-tax gain on the sale of certain gum brands of $5.7 million and the cumulative effect of accounting change of $7.4 million. Net income in 2002 was $403.6 million, which included total net business realignment charges of $21.5 million after tax and after-tax expenses of $10.9 million related to the exploration of the sale of the Company. The table below presents various items affecting the comparability of income over the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These items include a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves, the impact of business rationalization and realignment initiatives in 2003 and 2002, the gain on the sale of business in 2003 and charges to explore the sale of the Company in 2002. The Company believes the presentation of income excluding such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations which are indicative of its ongoing operations. The Company excludes such items in evaluating key measures of performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on its business. The Company believes that this presentation provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of the business. Financial results including the impact of the reduction to the provision for income taxes, business realignment and rationalization charges, the gain on the sale of business and expenses related to the possible sale of the Company, over the three-year period may be insufficient in facilitating a complete understanding of the business as a whole and ascertaining the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. Income per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 15% in 2004 and 13% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the Company’s increased sales, improved gross margin, control of selling, marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the period. This performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period, as discussed under the heading Return Measures on page 32. During 2005, the Company expects continued sales growth of 6%–7%, including growth at the top end of its long-term 3%–4% goal for the ongoing business, enhanced by the first year impact of the Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena acquisitions. The Company expects to continue to improve gross margin in 2005, despite higher input costs, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. These costs will be more than offset by price increases on its bar and packaged candy lines, announced in December 2004, that average approximately 3% over the entire domestic product line, and continued improvements in supply chain efficiency. Gross margin is expected to improve 30–40 basis points in 2005, including growth approaching the lower end of the Company’s long-term goal of 70–90 basis points for the ongoing business, reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. The Company expects to achieve 2005 growth in earnings per share-diluted of 9%–11%, excluding items affecting comparability, in line with its long-term goal. This growth will result from the sales and gross margin increases discussed above, combined with continued control of selling, marketing, and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from the share repurchases in 2004. The Company’s cash flow from operations is expected to remain strong. During 2005, the Company will repay the $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 by utilizing cash provided from operations and additional short-term borrowings. Primary challenges in 2005 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the core confectionery category and entry into the broader snack market. Focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels. The achievement of the Company’s objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and retailer consolidation, along with social issues such as childhood obesity concerns. In 2005, the Company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients, transportation and employee benefits. Successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the Company’s achievement of its growth objectives. The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Key risks to achieving future performance include: the continued ability to accelerate the introduction of new products, while balancing the rationalization of under-performing items; customer and consumer acceptance of announced price increases; achievement of targeted cost improvements; successful resolution of upcoming labor contract negotiations; intensified competitive activity in certain markets; changes to customers’ businesses and in the retail environment; changes in the regulatory environment, which includes tax laws as well as initiatives which could restrict or limit certain product sales; the ability to improve profitability of international businesses which are subject to certain volatility with regard to the economic and foreign currency exchange environment in certain countries; and the risk of increases in raw material and other costs. During the three years ended December 31, 2004, the Company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies. Over the long-term these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3%–4% per year, gross margin improvement of 70–90 basis points per year, 7%–9% annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes (“EBIT”) and 9%–11% earnings per share-diluted (“EPS”) growth per year. The Company expects continued sales growth in 2005 to be 6%–7%, including growth at the top end of its long-term goal for the ongoing business, enhanced by the first year impact of the Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena acquisitions. The Company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions. During 2005 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2004: Hershey’s Kisses brand filled with caramel milk chocolates, Ice Breakers Liquid Ice mints, Hershey’s Snack Barz rice and marshmallow bars, Hershey’s SmartZone nutrition bars, Take5 candy bars, Hershey’s, Almond Joy, York and Reese’s cookies, Reese’s Pieces candy with peanuts, and Reese’s Big Cup, previously sold as a limited edition item. Geographically, net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in North America. Growth outside North America will be focused on limited geographic areas offering attractive market opportunities. Gross margin is expected to improve 30–40 basis points in 2005, including growth approaching the lower end of the Company’s long-term goal of 70–90 basis points for the ongoing business, reduced by the impact of integrating the lower margin Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. Margin improvement is affected by various factors, including selling prices, promotional allowances, raw material costs, supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. During 2005, improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes, combined with improved supply chain efficiencies will more than offset higher input costs, primarily for raw materials, transportation and employee benefits. EBIT is expected to grow within the range of the long-term goal in 2005, as a result of the net sales growth and gross margin expansion, combined with careful control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. Net income and EPS in 2004 benefited from the non-recurring adjustment to income tax contingency reserves, which reduced the tax rate and income tax expense. In 2005, the tax rate will return to a more normal rate, estimated at 36.6%, offsetting the EBIT gains and resulting in relatively flat net income and EPS versus 2004. Excluding the impact of this non-recurring adjustment, net income and EPS are expected to increase within the range of the Company’s long-term goals. The Company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2005. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. The Company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2004, however, in January 2005, a contribution of $40.0 million was made to improve the funded status of the domestic plans. The Company’s cash flow from operations is expected to remain strong. During 2005, the Company will repay the $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes due in 2005 by utilizing cash provided from operations and additional short-term borrowings.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2019-02-26.@Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards, of which the most significant to the Firm was the guidance related to revenue recognition, and recognition and measurement of financial assets. The revenue recognition guidance requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, resulting in both total net revenue and total noninterest expense increasing with no impact to net income. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $505 million of fair value gains in the first quarter of 2018, recorded in total net revenue, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost. For additional information, refer to Note 1. JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for 2018, with record net income and EPS of $32.5 billion and $9.00 per share, respectively, on net revenue of $109.0 billion. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts (“TCJA”), net income and EPS were still records for a full year. The Firm reported ROE of 13% and ROTCE of 17%. For additional information related to the impact of the TCJA, refer to the Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 48–51 and Note 24. Net income increased 33%, reflecting higher net revenue and the impact of the lower U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Total net revenue increased 8%. Net interest income was $55.1 billion, up 10%, driven by the impact of higher rates, loan growth and Card margin expansion, partially offset by lower CIB Markets net interest income. Noninterest revenue was $54.0 billion, up 7%, largely driven by higher CIB Markets noninterest revenue and auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments and the impact of higher funding spreads on derivatives. Noninterest expense was $63.4 billion, up 7%, predominantly driven by investments in the business, including technology, marketing, higher compensation expense on increased headcount, and real estate, as well as higher revenue-related costs, including auto lease depreciation and volume-related transaction costs. The provision for credit losses was $4.9 billion, down from $5.3 billion in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the consumer provision driven by a lower addition to the credit card allowance for credit losses and lower net charge-offs. The lower net charge-offs were primarily driven by recoveries from loan sales in the residential real estate portfolio, predominantly offset by higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, as anticipated. The prior year also included a net $218 million write-down recorded in connection with the sale of the student loan portfolio. The decrease in the consumer provision was partially offset by an increase in the wholesale provision, reflecting additions to the allowance for loan losses from select client downgrades. The total allowance for credit losses was $14.5 billion at December 31, 2018, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.23%, compared with 1.27% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $5.2 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease from $6.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting improved credit performance in the consumer portfolio, and reductions in the wholesale portfolio including repayments and loan sales. Firmwide average core loans and core loans excluding CIB both increased 7%. The Firm’s Basel III Fully Phased-In CET1 capital was $183.5 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.0% and 12.9%, respectively. The Firm’s Fully Phased-In supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) was 6.4%. The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending 2018 at $56.33, up 5%. ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. Core loans and each of the Fully Phased-In capital and certain leverage measures are all considered key performance measures. For a further discussion of each of these measures, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 57-59, and Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94. These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. For a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties, refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 147 and the Risk Factors section on pages 7–28 . There is no assurance that actual results in 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2019 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects that it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal, regulatory, business and economic environments in which it operates. Management expects full-year 2019 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be in excess of $58 billion, reflecting the annualized impact of 2018 interest rate increases, as well as expected loan and deposit growth. The Firm takes a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing for growth and innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for the full-year 2019 to be less than $66 billion. The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at very low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects full-year 2019 net charge-offs to be less than $5.5 billion, higher than 2018, driven by growth. Management expects the first-quarter 2019 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately flat compared with the fourth-quarter of 2018. Firmwide adjusted expense for the first-quarter 2019 is expected to be up mid-single digits compared with the first quarter of 2018. Markets revenue for the first-quarter 2019 is expected to be lower when compared with the prior-year quarter by high-teens percentage points on a reported basis, and by low double-digit percentage points excluding the impact of the recognition and measurement accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018, depending on market conditions.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2018-02-27.@JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for full year 2017 with net income of $24.4 billion, or $6.31 per share, on net revenue of $99.6 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 10% and ROTCE of 12%. The Firm’s results included a $2.4 billion decrease to net income as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), driven by a deemed repatriation charge and adjustments to the value of the Firm’s tax-oriented investments, partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of the Firm’s net deferred tax liability. For additional information related to the impact of the TCJA, refer to Note 24. Net income decreased 1% driven by higher noninterest expense and income tax expense, predominantly offset by higher net interest income. Total net revenue increased by 4% driven by higher net interest income and investment banking fees, partially offset by lower Fixed Income Markets and Home Lending noninterest revenue. Noninterest expense was $58.4 billion, up 5%, driven by higher compensation expense, auto lease depreciation expense and continued investments across the businesses. The provision for credit losses was $5.3 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the wholesale provision driven by credit quality improvements in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines and Metals & Mining portfolios, offset by an increase in the consumer provision. The increase in the consumer provision was driven by higher net charge-offs and a higher addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio, and the impact of the sale of the student loan portfolio. The total allowance for credit losses was $14.7 billion at December 31, 2017, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.27%, compared with 1.34% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $6.4 billion, a decrease from the prior-year level of $7.5 billion. Firmwide average core loans increased 8%.

As a result of the change in tax rate due to the TCJA, management expects a reduction in tax-equivalent adjustments, decreasing both revenue and income tax expense, on a managed basis, by approximately $1.2 billion on an annual run-rate basis. Management expects the new revenue recognition accounting standard to increase both noninterest revenue and expense for full-year 2018 by approximately $1.2 billion, with most of the impact in the AWM business. For additional information on the new accounting standard, see Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 141. Management expects first-quarter 2018 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be down modestly compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by the impact of the TCJA and a lower day count. For full-year 2018, management expects net interest income, on a managed basis, to be in the $54 to $55 billion range, market dependent, and assuming expected core loan growth. Management expects Firmwide average core loan growth to be in the 6% to 7% range in 2018, excluding CIB loans. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, management expects Firmwide noninterest revenue for full-year 2018, on a managed basis, to be up approximately 7%, depending on market conditions. The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing for growth and innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for full-year 2018 to be less than $62 billion, excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Management estimates the full-year 2018 effective income tax rate to be in the 19% to 20% range, depending upon several factors, including the geographic mix of taxable income and refinements to estimates of the impacts of the TCJA. Management expects net charge-off rates to remain relatively flat across the wholesale and consumer portfolios, with the exception of Card. Management expects the full-year 2018 Card Services net revenue rate to be approximately 11.25%. In Card, management expects the net charge-off rate to increase to approximately 3.25% in 2018. Markets revenue in the first-quarter 2018 is expected to be up by mid to high single digit percentage points when compared with the prior-year quarter; actual Markets revenue results will continue to be affected by market conditions, which can be volatile. These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

See Forward-Looking Statements on page 145 and the Risk Factors section on pages 8–26. There is no assurance that actual results for the full year of 2018 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2018 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business.

.@0000019617.@JPM.@2017-02-28.@JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for full year 2016 with net income of $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share, on net revenue of $95.7 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 10% and ROTCE of 13%. Net income increased 1% compared with the prior year driven by lower noninterest expense and higher net revenue, predominantly offset by higher income tax expense and provision for credit losses. Total net revenue increased by 2% primarily reflecting higher net interest income across all the Firm’s business segments and higher Markets noninterest revenue in CIB, partially offset by lower card income in CCB and lower asset management fees in AWM. Noninterest expense was $55.8 billion, down 5% compared with the prior year, driven by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $5.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in the total consumer provision related to additions in the allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, and a lower benefit in the residential real estate portfolio driven by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year. The wholesale provision had a modest increase, largely driven by the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios. The total allowance for credit losses was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2016, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.34%, compared with 1.37% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.5 billion, an increase from the prior-year level of $7.0 billion. Firmwide average core loans increased 15% compared with the prior year. Within CCB, average core loans increased 20% from the prior year. CCB had record growth in average deposits, with a 10% increase from the prior year. Credit card sales volume increased 10%, and merchant processing volume increased 12%, from the prior year. CCB had nearly 27 million active mobile customers at year-end 2016, an increase of 16% from the prior year. CIB maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with a 8.1% wallet share for the full-year ended December 31, 2016. Within CB, record average loans increased 14% from the prior year as loans in the commercial and industrial client segment increased 9% and loans in the wholesale commercial real estate client segment increased 18%. AWM had record average loans, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and 79% of AWM’s mutual fund assets under management ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartiles over the past 5 years. The Firm added to its capital, ending the full-year of 2016 with a TBVPS of $51.44, up 7% over the prior year. The Firm’s estimated Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 capital and ratio were $182 billion and 12.2%, respectively. The Fully Phased-In supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) for the Firm and for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The Firm also was compliant with the Fully Phased-In U.S. LCR and had $524 billion of HQLA as of December 31, 2016. For further discussion of the LCR and HQLA, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110–115. ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Core loans are considered a key performance measure. Each of the Fully Phased-In capital and leverage measures is considered a key regulatory capital measure. JPMorgan Chase continues to support consumers, businesses and communities around the globe. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of $2.4 trillion for commercial and consumer clients during the full-year of 2016: $265 billion of credit for consumers $24 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $772 billion of credit for corporations $1.2 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $90 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities On October 1, 2016, the Firm filed with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its submission (the “2016 Resolution Submission”) describing how the Firm remediated certain deficiencies, and providing a status report on its actions to address certain shortcomings, that had been identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in April 2016 when those agencies provided feedback to the Firm as well as to seven other systemically important domestic banking institutions on their respective 2015 Resolution Plans. Among the steps taken by the Firm to address the identified deficiencies and shortcomings were: (i) establishing a new subsidiary that has become an “intermediate holding company” and to which JPMorgan Chase & Co. has contributed the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries (other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to JPMorgan Chase & Co.; (ii) increasing the Firm’s liquidity reserves and pre-positioning significant amounts of capital and liquidity at the Firm’s “material legal entities” (as defined in the 2016 Resolution Submission); (iii) refining the Firm’s liquidity and capital governance frameworks, including establishing a Firmwide “trigger framework” that identifies key actions and escalations that would need to be taken, as well as decisions that would need to be made, at critical points in time if certain defined liquidity and/or capital metrics were to fall below defined thresholds; (iv) establishing clear, actionable legal entity rationalization criteria and related governance procedures; and (v) improving divestiture readiness, including determining and analyzing divestiture options in a crisis. On December 13, 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC informed the Firm that they had determined that the Firm’s 2016 Resolution Submission adequately remediated the identified deficiencies in the Firm’s 2015 Resolution Plan. For more information, see the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites, and the Firm’s website for the public portion of the 2016 Resolution Submission. These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm’s actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full-year 2017 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. In the first quarter of 2017, management expects net interest income to increase modestly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. During 2017, assuming no change in interest rates since December 31, 2016, management expects net interest income could be approximately $3 billion higher than in 2016, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s rate increase in December 2016 and expected loan growth. Management expects average core loan growth of approximately 10% in 2017. The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at or near historically low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects total net charge-offs of approximately $5 billion in 2017. In Card, management expects the portfolio average net charge-off rate to increase in 2017, but remain below 3.00%, reflecting continued loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages, with quarterly net-charge offs reflecting normal seasonal trends. Management believes that the consumer allowance for credit losses could increase by approximately $300 million in 2017, reflecting growth across businesses, offset by reductions in the allowance for the residential real estate portfolio. Excluding the allowance related to the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines and Metals & Mining portfolios, management expects that the wholesale allowance for credit losses could increase modestly in 2017 reflecting growth across businesses. Continued stability in the energy sector could result in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. As management continually looks to enhance its credit loss estimation methodologies, the outlook for the allowance for credit losses does not take into consideration any such potential refinements. The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing in growth and innovation. As a result, Firmwide adjusted expense in 2017 is expected to be approximately $58 billion (excluding Firmwide legal expense). In CCB, management expects Mortgage noninterest revenue to decrease approximately $700 million in 2017, driven by margin compression in a smaller mortgage market and continued run-off of the Servicing portfolio, as well as approximately $200 million of MSR gains in 2016 which are not expected to recur in 2017. Management expects Card Services noninterest revenue to decrease approximately $600 million in 2017, reflecting the amortization of premiums on strong new product originations and the absence in 2017 of a gain on the sale of Visa Europe interests in 2016, although total Card Services revenue is expected to increase due to strong growth in net interest income. In the first quarter of 2017, management expects CCB expense to increase by approximately $150 million, compared to the prior quarter. In CIB, Investment Banking revenue in the first quarter of 2017 is expected to be approximately in line with the fourth quarter of 2016, dependent on the timing of the closing of a number of transactions. Treasury Services revenue is expected to be approximately $950 million in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, management currently expects Markets revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to increase modestly compared to the prior year quarter, with results sensitive to market conditions in March in light of particularly strong revenue in March 2016. In Securities Services, management expects revenue of approximately $900 million in the first quarter of 2017. Total net revenue increased by 2% primarily reflecting higher net interest income across all the Firm’s business segments and higher Markets noninterest revenue in CIB, partially offset by lower card income in CCB and lower asset management fees in AWM. Investment banking fees decreased predominantly due to lower equity underwriting fees driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 58–62 and Note 7. Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting broad-based strength across products in CIB’s Fixed Income Markets business. Rates performance was strong, with increased client activity driven by high issuance-based flows, global political developments, and central bank actions. Credit revenue improved driven by higher market-making revenue from the secondary market as clients’ appetite for risk recovered. For additional information, see CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 58–62 and pages 69–70, respectively, and Note 7. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased reflecting lower asset management fees in AWM driven by a reduction in revenue related to the disposal of assets at the beginning of 2016, the impact of lower average equity market levels and lower performance fees, as well as due to lower brokerage commissions and other fees in CIB and AWM. For additional information, see the segment discussions of CIB and AWM on pages 58–62 and pages 66–68, respectively, and Note 7. For information on lending- and deposit-related fees, see the segment results for CCB on pages 53–57, CIB on pages 58–62, and CB on pages 63–65 and Note 7; on securities gains, see the Corporate segment discussion on pages 69–70. Mortgage fees and related income were relatively flat, as lower mortgage servicing revenue related to lower average third-party loans serviced was predominantly offset by higher MSR risk management results. For further information on mortgage fees and related income, see the segment discussion of CCB on pages 53–57 and Notes 7 and 17. Card income decreased predominantly driven by higher new account origination costs and the impact of renegotiated co-brand partnership agreements, partially offset by higher card sales volume and other card-related fees. For further information, see CCB segment results on pages 53–57 and Note 7. Net interest income increased primarily driven by loan growth across the businesses and the net impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances and higher interest expense on long-term debt. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.1 trillion in 2016, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.25%, an increase of 11 basis points from the prior year.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2016-02-23.@JPMorgan Chase reported record full-year 2015 net income of $24.4 billion, and record earnings per share of $6.00, on net revenue of $93.5 billion. Net income increased by $2.7 billion compared with net income of $21.7 billion in 2014. ROE for the year was 11%, up from 10% in the prior year. The increase in net income in 2015 was driven by lower taxes and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses. The decline in net revenue was predominantly driven by lower Corporate private equity gains, lower CIB revenue reflecting the impact of business simplification, and lower CCB Mortgage Banking revenue. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit from a legal settlement in Corporate and higher operating lease income, predominantly in CCB. The decrease in noninterest expense was driven by lower CIB expense, reflecting the impact of business simplification, and lower CCB expense as a result of efficiencies, predominantly reflecting declines in headcount-related expense and lower professional fees, partially offset by investments in the business. As a result of these changes, the Firm’s overhead ratio in 2015 was lower compared with the prior year. The provision for credit losses increased from the prior year as a result of an increase in the wholesale provision, reflecting the impact of downgrades, including in the Oil & Gas portfolio. The consumer provision declined, reflecting lower net charge-offs due to continued discipline in credit underwriting, as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment levels. This was partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Total firmwide allowance for credit losses in 2015 was $14.3 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.37%, excluding the PCI portfolio, compared with 1.55% in the prior year. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans, excluding the PCI portfolio and credit card, was 117% compared with 106% in 2014. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $4.1 billion for the year, down $673 million from 2014. Nonperforming assets at year-end were $7.0 billion, down $933 million. The Firm’s results reflected solid underlying performance across its four major reportable business segments, with continued strong lending and consumer deposit growth. Firmwide average core loans increased by 12% compared with the prior year. Within CCB, Consumer & Business Banking average deposits increased 9% over the prior year. The Firm had nearly 23 million active mobile customers at year end, an increase of 20% over the prior year. Credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 7% for the year and merchant processing volume was up 12%. The CIB maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees according to Dealogic. CB had record average loans, with an 11% increase compared with the prior year. CB also had record gross investment banking revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% from the prior year. AM had positive net long-term client inflows and continued to deliver strong investment performance with 80% of mutual fund assets under management (“AUM”) ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartiles over the past five years. AM also increased average loan balances by 8% in 2015. In 2015, the Firm continued to adapt its strategy and financial architecture toward meeting regulatory and capital requirements and the changing banking landscape, while serving its clients and customers, investing in its businesses, and delivering strong returns to its shareholders. Importantly, the Firm exceeded all of its 2015 financial targets including those related to balance sheet optimization and managing its capital, its GSIB surcharge and expense. On capital, the Firm exceeded its capital target of reaching Basel III Fully Phased-In Advanced and Standardized CET1 ratios of approximately 11%, ending the year with estimated Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-in CET1 capital and ratio of $173.2 billion and 11.6%, respectively. The Firm also exceeded its target of reducing its GSIB capital surcharge, ending the year at an estimated 3.5% GSIB surcharge, achieved through a combination of reducing wholesale non-operating deposits, level 3 assets and derivative notionals. The Firm’s fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) was 6.5% and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s fully phased-in SLR was 6.6%. The Firm was also compliant with the fully phased-in U.S. liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) and had $496 billion of HQLA as of year-end 2015. The Firm’s tangible book value per share was $48.13, an increase of 8% from the prior year. Total stockholders’ equity was $247.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Tangible book value per share and each of these Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In measures are non-GAAP financial measures; they are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position and liquidity. The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of $2.0 trillion for its clients during 2015. This included $705 billion of credit to corporations, $233 billion of credit to consumers, and $22 billion to U.S. small businesses. During 2015, the Firm also raised $1.0 trillion of capital for clients. Additionally, $68 billion of credit was provided to, and capital was raised for, nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm has substantially completed its business simplification agenda, exiting businesses, products or clients that were non-core, not at scale or not returning the appropriate level of return in order to focus on core activities for its core clients and reduce risk to the Firm. While the business simplification initiative impacted revenue growth in 2015, it did not have a meaningful impact on the Firm’s profitability. The Firm continues to focus on streamlining, simplifying and centralizing operational functions and processes in order to attain more consistencies and efficiencies across the Firm. To that end, the Firm continues to make progress on simplifying its legal entity structure, streamlining its Global Technology function, rationalizing its use of vendors, and optimizing its real estate location strategy. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full-year 2016 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. In the first quarter of 2016, management expects net interest income and net interest margin to be relatively flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. During 2016, if there are no changes in interest rates, management expects net interest income could be approximately $2 billion higher than in 2015, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s rate increase in December 2015 and loan growth. Management expects core loan growth of approximately 10%-15% in 2016 as well as continued growth in retail deposits which are anticipated to lead to the Firm’s balance sheet growing to approximately $2.45 trillion in 2016. Management also expects managed noninterest revenue of approximately $50 billion in 2016, a decrease from 2015, primarily driven by lower Card revenue reflecting renegotiated co-brand partnership agreements and lower revenue in Mortgage Banking. The Firm continues to experience charge-offs at levels lower than its through-the-cycle expectations reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios, excluding Oil & Gas. Management expects total net charge-offs of up to approximately $4.75 billion in 2016. Based on the changes in market expectations for oil prices since year-end 2015, management believes reserves during the first quarter of 2016 could increase by approximately $500 million for Oil & Gas, and by approximately $100 million for Metals & Mining. The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing in growth and innovation. The Firm intends to leverage its scale and improve its operating efficiencies, in order to reinvest its expense savings in additional technology and marketing investments and fund other growth initiatives. As a result, Firmwide adjusted expense in 2016 is expected to be approximately $56 billion (excluding Firmwide legal expense). Additionally, the Firm will continue to adapt its capital assessment framework to review businesses and client relationships against multiple binding constraints, including GSIB and other applicable capital requirements, imposing internal limits on business activities to align or optimize the Firm’s balance sheet and risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) with regulatory requirements in order to ensure that business activities generate appropriate levels of shareholder value. During 2016, the Firm expects the CET1 capital ratio calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach to become its binding constraint. As a result of the anticipated growth in the balance sheet, management anticipates that the Firm will have, over time, $1.55 trillion in Standardized risk weighted assets, and is expecting that, over the next several years, its Basel III CET1 capital ratio will be between 11% and 12.5%. In the longer term, management expects to maintain a minimum Basel III CET1 ratio of 11%. It is the Firm’s current intention that the Firm’s capital ratios continue to exceed regulatory minimums as they are fully implemented in 2019 and thereafter. Likewise, the Firm will be evolving its funding framework to ensure it meets the current and proposed more stringent regulatory liquidity rules, including those relating to the availability of adequate Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”). In Mortgage Banking within CCB, management expects noninterest revenue to decline by approximately $700 million in 2016 as servicing balances continue to decline from year-end 2015 levels. The Card net charge-off rate is expected to be approximately 2.5% in 2016. In CIB, management expects Investment Banking revenue in the first quarter of 2016 to be approximately 25% lower than the prior year first quarter, driven by current market conditions in the underwriting businesses. In addition, Markets revenue to date in the first quarter of 2016 is down approximately 20%, when compared to a particularly strong period in the prior year and reflecting the current challenging market conditions. Prior year Markets revenue was positively impacted by macroeconomic events, including the Swiss franc decoupling from the Euro. Actual Markets revenue results for the first quarter will continue to be affected by market conditions, which can be volatile. In Securities Services, management expects revenue of approximately $875 million in the first quarter of 2016. Total net revenue for 2015 was down by 2% compared with the prior year, predominantly driven by lower Corporate private equity gains, lower CIB revenue reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives, and lower CCB Mortgage Banking revenue. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit from a legal settlement in Corporate, and higher operating lease income, predominantly in CCB. Investment banking fees increased from the prior year, reflecting higher advisory fees, partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting fees. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a greater share of fees for completed transactions as well as growth in industry-wide fee levels. The decrease in equity underwriting fees resulted from lower industry-wide issuance, and the decrease in debt underwriting fees resulted primarily from lower loan syndication and bond underwriting fees on lower industry-wide fee levels. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 94–98 and Note 7. Principal transactions revenue decreased from the prior year, reflecting lower private equity gains in Corporate driven by lower valuation gains and lower net gains on sales as the Firm exits this non-core business. The decrease was partially offset by higher client-driven market-making revenue, particularly in foreign exchange, interest rate and equity-related products in CIB, as well as a gain of approximately $160 million on CCB’s investment in Square, Inc. upon its initial public offering. For additional information, see CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 94–98 and pages 105–106, respectively, and Note 7. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased compared with the prior year, largely as a result of lower fees in CIB and lower performance fees in AM. The decrease was partially offset by higher asset management fees as a result of net client inflows into assets under management and the impact of higher average market levels in AM and CCB. Other income was relatively flat compared with the prior year, reflecting a $514 million benefit from a legal settlement in Corporate, higher operating lease income as a result of growth in auto operating lease assets in CCB, and the absence of losses related to the exit of non-core portfolios in Card. These increases were offset by the impact of business simplification in CIB; the absence of a benefit recognized in 2014 from a franchise tax settlement; and losses related to the accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non-operating deposits. Net interest income was relatively flat compared with the prior year, as lower loan yields, lower investment securities net interest income, and lower trading asset balance and yields were offset by higher average loan balances and lower interest expense on deposits. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.1 trillion in 2015, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.14%, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2015-02-24.@JPMorgan Chase reported record full-year 2014 net income of $21.8 billion, and record earnings per share of $5.29, on net revenue of $94.2 billion. Net income increased by $3.8 billion, or 21%, compared with net income of $17.9 billion, or $4.35 per share, in 2013. ROE for the year was 10%, compared with 9% for the prior year. The increase in net income in 2014 was driven by lower noninterest expense, largely offset by higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue. The decrease in noninterest expense was driven by lower legal expense as well as lower compensation expense. The provision for credit losses increased from the prior year as result of a lower level of benefit from reductions in the consumer allowance for loan losses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The decrease in the consumer allowance for loan losses was predominantly the result of continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio. The wholesale provision reflected a continued favorable credit environment. Total firmwide allowance for credit losses was $14.8 billion resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.55%, excluding the purchase credit-impaired (“PCI”) portfolio, compared with 1.80% in the prior year. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans retained, excluding the PCI portfolio and credit card, was 106% compared with 100% in 2013. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $4.8 billion for the year, down $1.0 billion, or 18% from 2013. Nonperforming assets at year-end were $8.0 billion, down $1.7 billion, or 18%. The Firm’s results reflected solid underlying performance across its four major reportable business segments, with continued strong lending and deposit growth. Consumer & Community Banking was #1 in deposit growth for the third consecutive year and Consumer & Business Banking within Consumer & Community Banking was #1 in customer satisfaction among the largest U.S. banks for the third consecutive year as measured by The American Customer Satisfaction Index (“ACSI”). Credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 11% for the year. The Corporate & Investment Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees and moved up to a #1 ranking in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), according to Dealogic. Commercial Banking loans increased to $149 billion, an 8% increase compared with the prior year. Commercial Banking also had record gross investment banking revenue of $2.0 billion, up 18% compared with the prior year. Asset Management achieved twenty-three consecutive quarters of positive net long-term client flows and increased average loan balances by 16% in 2014. The Firm maintained its fortress balance sheet, ending the year with an estimated Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-in CET1 capital ratio of 10.2%, compared with 9.5% in the prior year. Total deposits increased to $1.4 trillion, up 6% from the prior year. Total stockholders’ equity was $232 billion at December 31, 2014. (The Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-in CET1 capital ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Firm’s capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 146–153.) During 2014, the Firm continued to serve customers, corporate clients and the communities in which it does business. The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of $2.1 trillion for its clients during 2014; this included $19 billion lent to U.S. small businesses and $75 billion to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business. Over the past few years, the Firm has been adapting to the regulatory environment while continuing to serve its clients and customers, invest in its businesses, and deliver strong returns to its shareholders. The Firm’s initiatives include building a fortress control environment, de-risking and simplification of the organization, a disciplined approach to managing expense, evolving its capital assessment framework as well as rigorous optimization of the Firm’s balance sheet and funding. The Firm has been devoting substantial resources to execute on its control agenda. The Oversight and Control function, established in 2012, has been working closely and extensively with the Firm’s other control disciplines, including Compliance, Risk Management, Legal, Internal Audit, and other functions, to address the Firm's control-related projects that are cross-line of business and that have significant regulatory impact or respond to regulatory actions. The Firm’s investment in the control agenda and investment in technology, are considered by management to be essential to the Firm’s future. The Firm has substantially completed executing its business simplification agenda. In 2013, the Firm ceased originating student loans, exited certain high risk customers and became more selective about on-boarding certain customers. Following on these initiatives, in 2014, the Firm exited several non-core credit card co-branded relationships, sold the Retirement Plan Services business within AM, exited certain prepaid card businesses, reduced its offering of mortgage banking products, completed the sale of the CIB’s Global Special Opportunity Group investment portfolio, and the sale and liquidation of a significant part of CIB’s physical commodities business. In January 2015, the Firm completed the “spin out” of the One Equity Partners (“OEP”) private equity business (together with a sale of a portion of the OEP portfolio to a group of private equity firms). These actions will allow the Firm to focus on core activities for its core clients and reduce risk to the Firm. While it is anticipated that these exits will reduce revenues and expenses, they are not expected to have a meaningful impact on the Firm’s profitability. The Firm’s simplification agenda, however, is more extensive than exiting businesses, products or clients that were non-core, not at scale or not returning the appropriate level of return. The Firm is also focused on operational and structural simplicity, and streamlining and centralizing certain operational functions and processes in order to attain more consistencies and efficiencies across the Firm. To that end, the Firm is working on simplifying its legal entity structure, simplifying its Global Technology function, rationalizing its use of vendors, and optimizing its real estate location strategy. As the Firm continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulation and supervision, it continues to evolve its financial architecture to respond to this changing landscape. In 2014, the Firm exceeded the minimum capital levels required by the current rules and intends to continue to build capital in response to the higher Global Systemically Important Bank (“G-SIB”) capital surcharge proposed by U.S. banking regulators. In addition, the Firm is adapting its capital assessment framework to review businesses and client relationships against G-SIB and applicable capital requirements, and imposing internal limits on business activities to align or optimize the Firm's balance sheet and RWA with regulatory requirements in order to ensure that business activities generate appropriate levels of shareholder value. The Firm intends to balance return of capital to shareholders with achieving higher capital ratios over time. The Firm expects the capital ratio calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach to become its binding constraint by the end of 2015, or slightly thereafter. The Firm anticipates reaching Basel III Fully Phased-In Advanced and Standardized CET1 ratios of approximately 11% by the end of 2015 and is targeting a Basel III CET1 ratio of approximately 12% by the end of 2018, assuming a 4.5% G-SIB capital surcharge. If the Firm's G-SIB capital surcharge is lower than 4.5%, the Firm will adjust its Basel III CET1 target accordingly. Likewise, the Firm will be evolving its funding framework to ensure it meets the current and proposed more stringent regulatory liquidity rules, including those relating to the availability of adequate Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) at G-SIB organizations. The Firm estimated that it had, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 15% minimum TLAC as a percentage of Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-in RWA, excluding capital buffers currently in effect, based on its understanding of how the Financial Stability Board's proposal may be implemented in the U.S. While the precise composition and calibration of TLAC, as well as the conformance period, are yet to be defined by U.S. banking regulators, the Firm expects the requirement will lead to incremental debt issuance by the Firm and higher funding costs over the next few years. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in the year ahead in response to ongoing developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. The Firm intends to take a disciplined approach to growing revenues and controlling expenses in light of its capital and liquidity constraints. The Firm’s deep client relationships and its investments in its businesses, including branch optimization, new card relationships, expansion into new markets, and hiring additional sales staff and client advisors, are expected to generate significant revenue growth over the next several years. At the same time, the Firm intends to leverage its scale and improve its operating efficiencies so that it can fund these growth initiatives, as well as maintain its control and technology programs, without increasing its expenses. As a result, the Firm anticipates achieving a managed overhead ratio of approximately 55% over the next several years, including the impact of revenue growth. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full-year 2015 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. Management expects core loan growth of approximately 10% in 2015. The Firm continues to experience charge-offs at levels lower than its through-the-cycle expectations; if favorable credit trends continue, management expects the Firm’s total net charge offs could remain low, at an amount modestly over $4 billion in 2015, and expects a reduction in the consumer allowance for loan losses over the next two years. Firmwide adjusted expense in 2015 is expected to be approximately $57 billion, excluding Firmwide legal expenses and foreclosure-related matters. In Consumer & Business Banking within CCB, management expects continued spread compression in the deposit margin and a modest decline in net interest income in the first quarter of 2015. In Mortgage Banking within CCB, management expects quarterly servicing expense to decline to below $500 million by the second quarter of 2015 as default volume continues to decline. In Card Services within CCB, management expects the revenue rate in 2015 to remain at the low end of the target range of 12% to 12.5%. In CIB, Markets revenue in the first quarter of 2015 will be impacted by the Firm’s business simplification initiatives completed in 2014, resulting in a decline of approximately $500 million, or 10%, in Markets revenue and a decline of approximately $300 million in expense, compared to the prior year first quarter. Based on strong performance to date, particularly in January, management currently expects 2015 first quarter Markets revenue to be higher than the prior year first quarter, even with the negative impact of business simplification; however, Markets revenue actual results will depend on performance through the remainder of the quarter, which can be volatile. Overall, the Firm expects the impact from its business simplification initiatives will be a reduction of approximately $1.6 billion in revenue and a corresponding reduction of approximately $1.6 billion in expense resulting in no meaningful impact on the Firm’s 2015 anticipated net income. Total net revenue for 2014 was down by $2.4 billion, or 2%, compared with the prior year, predominantly due to lower mortgage fees and related income, and lower other income. The decrease was partially offset by higher asset management, administration and commissions revenue. Investment banking fees increased compared with the prior year, due to higher advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. The increase in advisory fees was driven by the combined impact of a greater share of fees for completed transactions, and growth in industry-wide fee levels. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by higher industry-wide issuance. The decrease in debt underwriting fees was primarily related to lower bond underwriting compared with a stronger prior year, and lower loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide fee levels. Investment banking fee share and industry-wide data are sourced from Dealogic, an external vendor. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 92–96, CB segment results on pages 97–99, and Note Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue primarily from the Firm’s client-driven market-making and private equity investing activities, increased compared with the prior year as the prior year included a $1.5 billion loss related to the implementation of the FVA framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. The increase was also due to higher private equity gains as a result of higher net gains on sales. The increase was partially offset by lower fixed income markets revenue in CIB, primarily driven by credit-related and rates products, as well as the impact of business simplification initiatives. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 92–96 and pages 103–104, respectively, and Note 7. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives and lower trade finance revenue in CIB. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher asset management fees driven by net client inflows and the effect of higher market levels in AM and CCB. The increase was offset partially by lower commissions and other fee revenue in CCB as a result of the exit of a non-core product in the second half of 2013. Securities gains decreased compared with the prior year, reflecting lower repositioning activity related to the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the prior year. The decrease was predominantly due to lower net production revenue driven by lower volumes due to higher levels of mortgage interest rates, and tighter margins. The decline in net production revenue was partially offset by a lower loss on the risk management of mortgage servicing rights. Card income remained relatively flat but included higher net interchange income on credit and debit cards due to growth in sales volume, offset by higher amortization of new account origination costs.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2014-02-20.@The global economy regained momentum in 2013, led by faster growth in the advanced economies, helped by decisive policy actions in the U.S., European Union, U.K., and Japan. Uncertainties about U.S. fiscal policy were reduced substantially by year-end, as were extreme downside risks to performance in the Eurozone and China that had been concerns earlier in the year. In addition, real consumer spending in the U.S. was supported late in the year by solid job growth, falling gasoline prices, and rising equity and house prices. The U.S. economic forecast for 2014 looks for a gradual acceleration in real sales growth and for inflation to remain well below the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee’s long-run target of 2%. If the economic forecast for 2014 is realized, the tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee will proceed and is expected to be completed before the end of 2014. However, the forecast does not look for a first rate hike by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee until sometime in 2015. The European Central Bank’s (“ECB”) support in stabilizing European financial markets, along with the constructive steps taken by the European Union to lay the groundwork for a more coherent banking union, helped the region to return to growth during the first half of 2013. However, later in the year, the pace of the Eurozone’s recovery remained slow, high unemployment tested the social and political stability of several of Europe’s weaker economies, and Cyprus became the fourth country in the Eurozone to receive a full bail-out. While Germany and the northern European economies continued to drive growth, elsewhere in Europe growth was more subdued. More encouraging were signs that the peripheral economies in the region are showing signs of healing. Economic performance in Asia was mixed in 2013. Japan boomed; in contrast, activity decelerated across much of the rest of the region. Growth outcomes were also mixed across Latin America. Economic activity decelerated in Mexico. Brazil began 2013 with positive momentum but then lost significant steam, with a widening gap between projected growth outcomes and inflation indicators. Policy uncertainties, slowing China demand for commodities, credit overhangs, and elevated inflation all weighed on investment in many emerging countries. In summary, there is reason to be optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook in 2014. The economy finally appears to have broken out of the 2% range of growth experienced in the first several years of recovery, and the extent of both fiscal policy restraint and fiscal policy uncertainty should be sharply reduced. While growth in emerging markets is expected to remain subdued, economic activity is expected to continue accelerating in Europe. JPMorgan Chase reported full-year 2013 net income of $17.9 billion, or $4.35 per share, on net revenue of $96.6 billion. Net income decreased by $3.3 billion, or 16%, compared with net income of $21.3 billion, or $5.20 per share, in 2012. ROE for the year was 9%, compared with 11% for the prior year. The decrease in net income in 2013 was driven by a higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher legal expense. The reduction in the provision for credit losses reflected continued favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. The decline in the provision for credit losses reflected lower consumer and wholesale provisions as net charge-offs decreased and the related allowance for credit losses was reduced by $5.6 billion in 2013. The decline in the allowance reflected improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolios, as well as improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate, credit card loan and wholesale portfolios. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $5.8 billion for the year, down $3.3 billion, or 36%, from 2012, which included $800 million of incremental charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. Nonperforming assets at year-end were $9.7 billion, down $2.2 billion, or 18%. Total firmwide allowance for credit losses was $17.0 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.80%, excluding the purchased credit-impaired portfolio, compared with 2.43% in 2012. The Firm’s results reflected strong underlying performance across its four major reportable business segments, with strong lending and deposit growth. Consumer & Business Banking within Consumer & Community Banking was #1 in deposit growth for the second year in a row and #1 in customer satisfaction among the largest banks for the second year in a row as measured by The American Customer Satisfaction Index (“ACSI”). In Card, Merchant Services & Auto, credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 10% for the year. The Corporate & Investment Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees and reported record assets under custody of $20.5 trillion at December 31, 2013. Commercial Banking loans increased to a record $137.1 billion, a 7% increase compared with the prior year. Asset Management achieved nineteen consecutive quarters of positive net long-term client flows into assets under management. Asset Management also increased loan balances to a record $95.4 billion at December 31, 2013. JPMorgan Chase ended the year with a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 10.7%, compared with 11% at year-end 2012. The Firm estimated that its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approach on a fully phased-in basis, based on the interim final rule issued in October 2013, was 9.5% as of December 31, 2013. Total deposits increased to $1.3 trillion, up 8% from the prior year. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2013, was $211.2 billion. (The Basel I and III Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 161–165 of this Annual Report.) During 2013, the Firm worked to help its customers, corporate clients and the communities in which it does business. The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of more than $2.1 trillion for its clients during 2013; this included $19 billion lent to small businesses and $79 billion to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm also originated more than 800,000 mortgages. The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with the reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, for each line of business and the Firm as a whole, includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue on a tax-equivalent basis.  As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. For a summary of the more significant rules and regulations to which it currently is or will shortly be subject, as well as the more noteworthy rules and regulations currently being proposed to be implemented, see Supervision and Regulation on pages 1–9 of the 2013 Form 10-K. Having reached the minimum capital levels required by the new and proposed rules, the Firm intends to continue to hold excess capital in order to support its businesses. However, the new rules will require the Firm to modify its on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities to meet the supplementary leverage ratio requirements, restrict or limit the way the Firm offers products to customers or charges fees for services, exit certain activities and product offerings, and make structural changes with respect to which of its legal entities offer certain products in order to comply with the margin, extraterritoriality and clearing rules promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The Firm intends to respond to the new financial architecture resulting from this changing landscape in a way that will allow it to grow its revenues over time, manage its expenses, and comply with the new regulatory requirements, while at the same time investing in its businesses and meeting the needs of its customers and clients. Initiatives will include a disciplined approach to capital and liquidity management as well as optimization of the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm intends to continue to meet the higher U.S. and Basel III liquidity requirements and make progress towards meeting all of its capital targets in advance of regulatory deadlines, while at the same time returning capital to its shareholders. The Firm is also devoting substantial resources in order to continue to execute on its control and regulatory agendas. In 2012, it established its Oversight and Control function, which works closely with all control disciplines, including Compliance, Legal, Risk Management, Internal Audit and other functions, to provide a cohesive and centralized view of control functions and issues and to address complex control-related projects that are cross-line of business and that have significant regulatory impact or respond to regulatory actions such as the Consent Orders. See Operational Risk Management on pages 155–157 in this Annual Report for further information on the Oversight and Control function. The Firm’s control agenda is receiving significant senior management and Board of Director attention and oversight, and represents a very high priority for the Firm, with 23 work-streams currently underway involving more than 3,500 employees. In 2013, the Firm increased the amount spent on the control agenda by approximately $1 billion, and expects to spend an incremental amount of slightly more than $1 billion on the control agenda in 2014. The Firm is also executing a business simplification agenda that will allow it to focus on core activities for its core clients and better manage its operational, regulatory and litigation risks. These initiatives include ceasing student loan originations, ceasing to offer traveler’s checks and money orders for non-customers, exiting certain high-complexity arrangements (such as third-party lockbox services), and being more selective about on-boarding certain customers, among other initiatives. These business simplification changes will not fundamentally change the breadth of the Firm’s business model. However, they are anticipated to reduce both revenues and expenses over time, although the effect on annualized net income is expected to be modest. In addition, the efforts are also expected to have the benefit of freeing up capital over time. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, capital and liquidity management practices, and legal entity structure in the year ahead in response to developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full year 2014 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects that net interest margin will be relatively stable in the near term. Firmwide adjusted expense is expected to be below $59 billion for the full year 2014, excluding firmwide (Corporate and non-Corporate) legal expenses and foreclosure-related matters, even as the Firm continues to invest in controls and compliance. In the Mortgage Banking business within CCB, management expects that higher levels of mortgage interest rates will continue to have a negative impact on refinancing volumes and margins, and, accordingly, the pretax income of Mortgage Production is anticipated to be modestly negative for the first quarter of 2014. For Real Estate Portfolios within Mortgage Banking, if delinquencies continue to trend down and the macro-economic environment remains stable or improves, management expects charge-offs to decline and a further reduction in the allowance for loan losses. In Card Services within CCB, the Firm expects that spread compression will continue in 2014; the shift from high-rate and low-FICO balances is expected to be replaced by more engaged customers or transactors, which is expected to positively affect card spend and credit performance in 2014. If current positive credit trends continue, the card-related allowance for loan losses could be reduced over the course of 2014. The currently anticipated results for CCB described above could be adversely affected if economic conditions, including U.S. housing prices or the unemployment rate, do not continue to improve. Management continues to closely monitor the portfolios in these businesses. In Private Equity, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, earnings will likely continue to be volatile and influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific factors. For Treasury and CIO, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, as the Firm continues to reinvest its investment securities portfolio, net interest income is expected to improve and to reach break-even during the second half of 2014.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2013-02-28.@The Eurozone crisis was center stage the beginning of the year, with social stresses and fears of breakup of the Euro. However, strong stands by Eurozone states and the European Central Bank (“ECB”) helped stabilize the Eurozone later in the year. The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (“OMT”) program showed its commitment to provide a safety net for European nations. Eurozone member states also took crucial steps toward further fiscal integration by handing over power to the ECB to regulate the largest banks in the Euro area and by passing more budgetary authority to the European Union. Despite the easing of the crisis, the economies of many of the European Union member countries stalled in 2012. Asia’s developing economies continued to expand in 2012, although growth was significantly slower than the previous year, reducing global inflationary pressures. In the U.S., the economy grew at a modest pace and the unemployment rate declined to a four year low of 7.8% by the end of 2012 as U.S. labor market conditions continued to improve. The U.S. housing market turned the corner during 2012 as the sector continued to show signs of improvement: excess inventories were reduced, prices began to rise and home affordability improved in most areas of the country as household incomes stabilized and mortgage rates declined to historic lows. Homebuilder confidence improved to the highest level in six years and housing starts increased to the highest level in four years during 2012. At the same time, inflation remained below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s (the “Federal Reserve”) 2% long-run goal. The Federal Reserve maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to one quarter percent and tied the interest rate forecasts to the evolution of the economy, in particular inflation and unemployment rates. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced a new asset purchase program that would be open-ended and is intended to speed up the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and produce sustained improvement in the labor market. Financial markets reacted favorably when the U.S. Congress reached an agreement to resolve the so-called “fiscal cliff” by passing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This Act made permanent most of the tax cuts initiated in 2001 and 2003 and allowed the tax rate on the top income bracket, which was increased to $450,000 annually for joint tax filers, to revert to 39.6% from 35.0%. Spending and debt ceiling issues were postponed into 2013. Going into 2013, the U.S. economy is likely to be affected by the continuing uncertainty about Europe’s financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, and the ongoing fiscal debate over the U.S. debt limit, government spending and taxes. JPMorgan Chase reported full-year 2012 record net income of $21.3 billion, or $5.20 per share, on net revenue of $97.0 billion. Net income increased by $2.3 billion, or 12%, compared with net income of $19.0 billion, or $4.48 per share, in 2011. ROE for both 2012 and 2011 was 11%. The increase in net income in 2012 was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was flat compared with 2011 as lower principal transactions revenue and lower net interest income were offset by higher mortgage fees and related income, higher other income, and higher securities gains. Principal transactions revenue for 2012 included losses from the synthetic credit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher compensation expense. The decline in the provision for credit losses reflected a lower consumer provision as net charge-offs decreased and the related allowance for credit losses was reduced by $5.5 billion in 2012. The decline in the consumer allowance reflected improved delinquency trends and reduced estimated losses in the real estate and credit card loan portfolios. The wholesale credit environment remained favorable throughout 2012. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $9.1 billion for the year, down $3.2 billion, or 26%, from 2011, and nonperforming assets at year-end were $11.7 billion, up $419 million, or 4%. The current year included the effect of regulatory guidance implemented during 2012, which resulted in the Firm reporting an additional $3.0 billion of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2012 (see Consumer, excluding credit card on pages 140–148 of this Annual Report for further information). Before the impact of these reporting changes, nonperforming assets would have been $8.7 billion at December 31, 2012. The total firmwide allowance for credit losses was $22.6 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 2.43% of total loans, excluding the purchased credit-impaired portfolio. The Firm’s 2012 results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all its businesses, with strong lending and deposit growth. Consumer & Business Banking within Consumer & Community Banking added 106 branches and increased deposits by 11% in 2012. Business Banking loans increased to a record $18.9 billion, up 7% compared with 2011. Mortgage Banking reported strong production revenue driven by strong originations growth. In Card, Merchant Services & Auto, credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 11% for the year. The Corporate & Investment Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees and reported record assets under custody of $18.8 trillion at December 31, 2012. Commercial Banking reported record net revenue of $6.8 billion and record net income of $2.6 billion in 2012. Commercial Banking loans increased to a record $128.2 billion, a 14% increase compared with the prior year. Asset Management reported record revenue in 2012 and achieved its fifteenth consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client flows into assets under management. Asset Management also increased loan balances to a record $80.2 billion at December 31, 2012. JPMorgan Chase ended the year with a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 11.0%, compared with 10.1% at year-end 2011. The Firm estimated that its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 8.7% at December 31, 2012, taking into account the impact of final Basel 2.5 rules and the proposals set forth in the Federal Reserve’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”). Total deposits increased to $1.2 trillion, up 6% from the prior year. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012, was $204.1 billion. (The Basel I and III Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 117–120 of this Annual Report.) During 2012, the Firm worked to help its customers, corporate clients and the communities in which it does business. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of more than $1.8 trillion for its clients during 2012; this included $20 billion lent to small businesses and $85 billion for nearly 1,500 non-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm also originated more than 920,000 mortgages, and provided credit cards to approximately 6.7 million people. Since the beginning of 2009, the Firm has offered nearly 1.4 million mortgage modifications and of these approximately 610,000 have achieved permanent modifications. In addition, despite the damage and disruption at many of its branches and facilities caused by Superstorm Sandy at the end of October 2012, the Firm continued to assist customers, clients and borrowers in the affected areas. The Firm continued to dispense cash through ATMs, loan money, provide liquidity to customers, and settle trades, and it waived a number of checking account and loan fees, including late payment fees, for the benefit of its customers. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full year 2013 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. In the Consumer & Business Banking business within CCB, the Firm estimates that, given the current low interest rate environment, continued deposit spread compression could negatively impact annual net income by approximately $400 million in 2013. This decline may be offset by the impact of deposit balance growth, although the exact extent of any such deposit growth cannot be determined at this time. In the Mortgage Banking business within CCB, management expects to continue to incur elevated default- and foreclosure-related costs, including additional costs associated with the Firm’s mortgage servicing processes, particularly its loan modification and foreclosure procedures. In addition, management believes that the high production margins experienced in recent quarters likely peaked in 2012 and will decline over time. Management also expects there will be continued elevated levels of repurchases of mortgages previously sold, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”). However, based on current trends and estimates, management believes that the existing mortgage repurchase liability is sufficient to cover such losses. For Real Estate Portfolios within Mortgage Banking, management believes that total quarterly net charge-offs may be approximately $550 million, subject to economic conditions. If the positive credit trends in the residential real estate portfolio continue or accelerate and economic uncertainty declines, the related allowance for loan losses may be reduced over time. Given management’s current estimate of portfolio runoff levels, the residential real estate portfolio is expected to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2013 from year-end 2012 levels. The run-off in the residential real estate portfolio can be expected to reduce annual net interest income by approximately $600 million in 2013. Over time, the reduction in net interest income should be offset by an improvement in credit costs and lower expenses. In Card Services within CCB, the Firm expects that, if current positive credit trends continue, the card- related allowance for loan losses could be reduced by up to $1 billion over the course of 2013. The currently anticipated results for CCB described above could be adversely affected if economic conditions, including U.S. housing prices or the unemployment rate, do not continue to improve. Management continues to closely monitor the portfolios in these businesses. In Private Equity, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, earnings will likely continue to be volatile and influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific issues. For Treasury and CIO, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, management expects a quarterly net loss of approximately $300 million with that amount likely to vary driven by the implied yield curve and management decisions related to the positioning of the investment securities portfolio. For Other Corporate, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, management expects quarterly net income, excluding material litigation expense and significant items, if any, to be approximately $100 million, but this amount is also likely to vary each quarter. Management expects the Firm's net interest income to be generally flat during 2013, as modest pressure on the net yield on interest-earning assets is expected to be generally offset by anticipated growth in interest-earning assets. The Firm continues to focus on expense discipline and is targeting expense for 2013 to be approximately $1 billion lower than in 2012 (not taking into account, for such purposes, any expenses in each year related to corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters). Total net revenue for 2012 was $97.0 billion, down slightly from 2011. Results for 2012 were driven by lower principal transactions revenue from losses incurred by CIO, and lower net interest income. These items were predominantly offset by higher mortgage fees and related income in CCB and higher other income in Corporate/Private Equity. Investment banking fees decreased slightly from 2011, reflecting lower advisory fees on lower industry-wide volumes, and to a lesser extent, slightly lower equity underwriting fees on industry-wide volumes that were flat from the prior year. These declines were predominantly offset by record debt underwriting fees, driven by favorable market conditions and the impact of continued low interest rates. For additional information on investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in CIB. Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue primarily from the Firm’s market-making and private equity investing activities, decreased compared with 2011, predominantly due to $5.8 billion of losses incurred by CIO from the synthetic credit portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and $449 million of losses incurred by CIO from the retained index credit derivative positions for the three months ended September 30, 2012; and additional modest losses incurred by CIB from the synthetic credit portfolio in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2012. Principal transaction revenue also included a $930 million loss in 2012, compared with a $1.4 billion gain in 2011, from DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities, resulting from the tightening of the Firm’s credit spreads. These declines were partially offset by higher market-making revenue in CIB, driven by strong client revenue and higher revenue in rates-related products, as well as a $665 million gain recognized in Other Corporate associated with the recovery on a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. Private equity gains decreased in 2012, predominantly due to lower unrealized and realized gains on private investments, partially offset by higher unrealized gains on public securities. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see CIB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 92–95 and 102–104, respectively, and Note 7 on pages 228–229 of this Annual Report. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased in 2012 compared with the prior year. The decrease predominantly reflected lower lending-related fees in CIB and lower deposit-related fees in CCB. For additional information on lending- and deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in CCB, CIB and CB, see the segment results for CCB on pages 80–91, CIB on pages 92–95 and CB on pages 96–98 of this Annual Report. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased from 2011. The decrease was largely driven by lower brokerage commissions in CIB. This decrease was largely offset by higher asset management fees in AM driven by net client inflows, the effect of higher market levels, and higher performance fees; and higher investment service fees in CCB, as a result of growth in branch sales of investment products. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for CIB on pages 92–95, CCB on pages 80–91, AM on pages 99–101, and Note 7 on pages 228–229 of this Annual Report. Securities gains increased, compared with the 2011 level, reflecting the results of repositioning the CIO available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities portfolio. For additional information on securities gains, which are mostly recorded in the Firm’s Corporate/Private Equity segment, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 102–104, and Note 12 on pages 244–248 of this Annual Report. Mortgage fees and related income increased significantly in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase resulted from higher production revenue, reflecting wider margins driven by favorable market conditions; and higher volumes due to historically low interest rates and the Home Affordable Refinance Programs (“HARP”). The increase also resulted from a favorable swing in risk management results related to mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), which was a gain of $619 million in 2012, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2011. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded predominantly in CCB, see CCB’s Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing discussion on pages 85–87, and Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report. Card income decreased during 2012, driven by lower debit card revenue, reflecting the impact of the Durbin Amendment; and to a lesser extent, higher amortization of loan origination costs. The decrease in credit card income was offset partially by higher net interchange income associated with growth in credit card sales volume, and higher merchant servicing revenue. For additional information on credit card income, see the CCB segment results on pages 80–91 of this Annual Report. Other income increased in 2012 compared with the prior year, largely due to a $1.1 billion benefit from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement, and $888 million of extinguishment gains in Corporate/Private Equity related to the redemption of trust preferred securities (“TruPS”). The extinguishment gains were related to adjustments applied to the cost basis of the TruPS during the period they were in a qualified hedge accounting relationship. These items were offset partially by the absence of a prior-year gain on the sale of an investment in AM. Net interest income decreased in 2012 compared with the prior year, predominantly reflecting the impact of lower average trading asset balances, the runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster prepayment of mortgage-backed securities, limited reinvestment opportunities, as well as the impact of lower interest rates across the Firm’s interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower deposit and other borrowing costs. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $1.8 trillion for 2012, and the net yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.48%, a decrease of 26 basis points from 2011.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2012-02-29.@The global economy lost some momentum during 2011 in the face of several new threats, some transitory and some more deeply entrenched. In the first half of the year, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan represented a significant setback to that country's important economy and probably disrupted activity elsewhere in the world as well, particularly in the global motor vehicle sector. Later in the year, severe floods in Thailand also disrupted motor vehicle supply chains. Furthermore, a sharp rise in oil prices in the spring in the wake of political unrest in the Middle East slowed consumer demand. Although many of these shocks eased later in the year, Europe’s financial crisis posed a new threat. Concerns about sovereign debt in Greece and other Eurozone countries, which raised doubts in the investor community about the viability of the European monetary union, as well as the sovereign debt exposures of the European banking system, were a source of stress in the global financial markets during the second half of 2011. In December 2011, the European Central Bank (“ECB”) announced measures to support bank lending and money market activity, offering 36-month, 1 percent loans through two longer-term refinancing operations, known as LTROs. These programs replaced a 12-month lending facility established by the ECB in October 2011 and also allowed banks to use a wider variety of assets as collateral for the loans. The ECB’s actions were expected to ease near-term concerns about European bank funding and liquidity. Despite these headwinds, there were a number of promising developments in the U.S. during 2011. The credit environment improved as consumer and wholesale delinquencies decreased and lending for a broad range of purposes accelerated. Housing prices continued to be largely unchanged and rose in the non-distressed sector, while home builders continued to make good progress working off the excess housing inventory that was built in the last decade. Despite the turmoil in the summer months associated with the debt ceiling crisis and a worsening of the crisis in Europe, the U.S. job market continued to improve, with layoffs easing, employment expanding steadily, and unemployment falling. At the same time the financial health of the business sector, which was already strong, continued to improve. Reflecting these favorable trends, the equity market recovered from the late summer drop. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) took several actions during 2011 to support a stronger economic recovery and to help support conditions in mortgage markets. These actions included extending the average maturity of its holdings of securities, reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities into other agency mortgage-backed securities and maintaining its existing policy of rolling over maturing U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”) securities at auction. The Federal Reserve maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to one-quarter percent and, in January 2012, provided specific guidance regarding its prediction about policy rates, stating that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. Also, the Federal Reserve reactivated currency swap lines with the ECB in response to pressures in interbank term funding markets. JPMorgan Chase reported full-year 2011 record net income of $19.0 billion, or $4.48 per share, on net revenue of $97.2 billion. Net income increased by $1.6 billion, or 9%, compared with net income of $17.4 billion, or $3.96 per share, in 2010. ROE for the year was 11%, compared with 10% for the prior year. The increase in net income in 2011 was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, predominantly offset by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense. The reduction in the provision for credit losses reflected continued improvement in the consumer portfolios. The decline in net revenue from 2010 was driven by lower net interest income, securities gains, mortgage fees and related income, and principal transactions revenue, partially offset by higher asset management, administration and commissions revenue and higher other income. The increase in noninterest expense was driven largely by higher compensation expense, reflecting increased headcount. During 2011, the credit quality of the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio improved. The delinquency trends in the consumer business modestly improved, though the rate of improvement seen earlier in 2011 slowed somewhat in the latter half of the year. Mortgage net charge-offs and delinquencies modestly improved, but both remained at elevated levels. These positive consumer credit trends resulted in reductions in the allowance for loan losses in Card Services & Auto and in Retail Financial Services (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans). The allowance for loan losses associated with the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio in Retail Financial Services increased, reflecting higher than expected loss frequency relative to modeled lifetime loss estimates. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $12.2 billion for the year, down $11.4 billion, or 48%, from 2010, and nonperforming assets at year-end were $11.0 billion, down $5.5 billion, or 33%. Total firmwide credit reserves were $28.3 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 3.35% of total loans, excluding the purchased credit-impaired portfolio. Net income performance varied among JPMorgan Chase’s lines of business, but underlying metrics in each business showed positive trends. The second half of 2011 reflected a challenging investment banking and capital markets environment which contributed to lower revenue for the year in the Investment Bank (excluding debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) gains). However, the Investment Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees for the year. Consumer & Business Banking within Retail Financial Services opened 260 new branches and increased deposits by 8% in 2011. In the Card business, credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 10% for the year. Treasury & Securities Services reported record average liability balances, up 28% for 2011, and a 73% increase in trade loans. Commercial Banking also reported record average liability balances, up 26% for the year, and record revenue and net income for the year. The fourth quarter of 2011 also marked CB’s sixth consecutive quarter of loan growth, including a 17% increase in middle-market loans over the prior year end. Asset Management reported record revenue for the year and achieved eleven consecutive quarters of positive long-term flows into assets under management. JPMorgan Chase ended the year with a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 10.1%, compared with 9.8% at year-end 2010. This strong capital position enabled the Firm to repurchase $8.95 billion of common stock and warrants during 2011. The Firm estimated that its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 7.9% at December 31, 2011. Total deposits increased to $1.1 trillion, up 21% from the prior year. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2011, was $183.6 billion. The Basel I and III Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 119–123 of this Annual Report. During 2011, the Firm worked to help its individual customers, corporate clients and the communities in which it does business. The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of more than $1.8 trillion for its clients during 2011, up 18% from 2010; this included $17 billion lent to small businesses, up 52%, and $68 billion to more than 1,200 not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm also originated more than 765,000 mortgages, and provided credit cards to approximately 8.5 million people. The Firm remains committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures. Since the beginning of 2009, the Firm has offered more than 1.2 million mortgage modifications, of which approximately 452,000 have achieved permanent modification as of December 31, 2011. The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with the reported results under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, for each line of business and the Firm as a whole, includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue on a tax-equivalent basis. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Firm’s managed-basis presentation also included certain reclassification adjustments that assumed credit card loans securitized by Card remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see pages 76–78 of this Annual Report. Total net revenue for 2011 was $97.2 billion, a decrease of $5.5 billion, or 5%, from 2010. Results for 2011 were driven by lower net interest income in several businesses, lower securities gains in Corporate/Private Equity, lower mortgage fees and related income in RFS, and lower principal transactions revenue in Corporate/Private Equity. These declines were partially offset by higher asset management fees, largely in AM. Investment banking fees decreased from 2010, predominantly due to declines in equity and debt underwriting fees. The impact from lower industry-wide volumes in the second half of 2011 more than offset the Firm's record level of debt underwriting fees in the first six months of the year. Advisory fees increased for the year, reflecting higher industry-wide completed M&A volumes relative to the 2010 level. For additional information on investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 81–84, and Note 7 on pages 211–212 of this Annual Report. Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue from the Firm's market-making and private equity investing activities, decreased compared with 2010. This was driven by lower trading revenue and lower private equity gains. Trading revenue included a $1.4 billion gain from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative liabilities, resulting from the widening of the Firm's credit spreads, partially offset by a $769 million loss, net of hedges, from CVA on derivative assets within Credit Portfolio in IB, due to the widening of credit spreads of the Firm's counterparties. The prior year included a $509 million gain from DVA, partially offset by a $403 million loss, net of hedges, from CVA. Excluding DVA and CVA, lower trading revenue reflected the impact of the second half of 2011's challenging market conditions on Corporate and IB. Lower private equity gains were primarily due to net write-downs on privately-held investments and the absence of prior-year gains from sales in the Private Equity portfolio. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see IB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 81–84 and 107–108, respectively, and Note 7 on pages 211–212 of this Annual Report. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased modestly in 2011 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the introduction in the first quarter of 2011 of a new checking account product offering in RFS, and the subsequent conversion of certain existing accounts into the new product. The increase was offset partly by the impact of regulatory and policy changes affecting nonsufficient fund/overdraft fees in RFS. For additional information on lending- and deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in RFS, CB, TSS and IB, see RFS on pages 85–93, CB on pages 98–100, TSS on pages 101–103 and IB on pages 81–84 of this Annual Report. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased from 2010, reflecting higher asset management fees in AM and RFS, driven by net inflows to products with higher margins and the effect of higher market levels; and higher administration fees in TSS, reflecting net inflows of assets under custody. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for AM on pages 104–106, RFS on pages 85–93 and TSS on pages 101–103, and Note 7 on pages 211–212 of this Annual Report. Securities gains decreased compared with the 2010 level, primarily due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in response to changes in the current market environment and to rebalancing exposures. For additional information on securities gains, which are mostly recorded in the Firm's Corporate/Private Equity segment, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 107–108, and Note 12 on pages 225–230 of this Annual Report. Mortgage fees and related income decreased in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting a MSR risk management loss of $1.6 billion for 2011, compared with income of $1.1 billion for 2010, largely offset by lower repurchase losses in 2011. The $1.6 billion loss was driven by a $7.1 billion loss due to a decrease in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, which was predominantly offset by a $5.6 billion gain on the derivatives used to hedge the MSR asset. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS, see RFS's Mortgage Production and Servicing discussion on pages 89–91, and Note 17 on pages 267–271 of this Annual Report. For additional information on repurchase losses, see the Mortgage repurchase liability discussion on pages 115–118 and Note 29 on pages 283–289 of this Annual Report. Credit card income increased during 2011, largely reflecting higher net interchange income associated with higher customer transaction volume on credit and debit cards, as well as lower partner revenue-sharing due to the impact of the Kohl's portfolio sale. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue from fee-based products, as well as the impact of the Durbin Amendment. For additional information on credit card income, see the Card and RFS segment results on pages 94–97, and pages 85–93, respectively, of this Annual Report. Other income increased in 2011, driven by valuation adjustments on certain assets and incremental revenue from recent acquisitions in IB, and higher auto operating lease income in Card, resulting from growth in lease volume. Also contributing to the increase was a gain on the sale of an investment in AM. Net interest income decreased in 2011 compared with the prior year, driven by lower average loan balances and yields in Card and RFS, reflecting the expected runoff of credit card balances and residential real estate loans; lower fees on credit card receivables, reflecting the impact of legislative changes; higher average interest-bearing deposit balances and related yields; and lower yields on securities, reflecting portfolio repositioning in anticipation of an increasing interest rate environment. The decrease was offset partially by lower revenue reversals associated with lower credit card charge-offs, and higher trading asset balances. The Firm's average interest-earning assets were $1.8 trillion for the 2011 full year, and the net yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.74%, a decrease of 32 basis points from 2010. For further information on the impact of the legislative changes on the Consolidated Statements of Income, see Card discussion on credit card legislation on page 94 of this Annual Report.
 .@0000019617.@JPM.@2011-02-28.@Against the backdrop of the improvement in the business environment during the year, JPMorgan Chase reported full-year 2010 record net income of $17.4 billion, or $3.96 per share, on net revenue of $102.7 billion. Net income was up 48% compared with net income of $11.7 billion, or $2.26 per share, in 2009. Return on common equity was 10% for the year, compared with 6% for the prior year. The increase in net income for 2010 was driven by a lower provision for credit losses and higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. The lower provision for credit losses reflected improvements in both the consumer and wholesale provisions. The increase in net revenue was due predominantly to higher securities gains in the Corporate/Private Equity segment, increased other income and increased principal transactions revenue, partially offset by lower credit card income. The increase in noninterest expense was largely due to higher litigation expense. JPMorgan Chase benefited from an improvement in the credit environment during 2010. Compared with 2009, delinquency trends were more favorable and estimated losses were lower in the consumer businesses, although they remained at elevated levels. The credit quality of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio across the Firm’s wholesale businesses improved. In addition, for the year, net charge-offs were lower across all businesses, though the level of net charge-offs in the Firm’s mortgage portfolio remained very high and continued to be a significant drag on returns. These positive credit trends resulted in reductions in the allowance for credit losses in Card Services, the loan portfolio in Retail Financial Services (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans), and in the Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. Nevertheless, the allowance for loan losses associated with the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio in Retail Financial Services increased, reflecting an increase in estimated future credit losses largely related to home equity, and, to a lesser extent, option ARM loans. Total firmwide credit reserves at December 31, 2010, were $33.0 billion, resulting in a firmwide loan loss coverage ratio of 4.5% of total loans. Strong client relationships and continued investments for growth resulted in good results across most of the Firm’s businesses, including record revenue and net income in Commercial Banking, record revenue in Asset Management and solid results across most other businesses. For the year, the Investment Bank ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking Fees; Retail Financial Services added more than 150 new branches and 5,000 salespeople, and opened more than 1.5 million net new checking accounts; Card Services rolled out new products and opened 11.3 million new accounts; Treasury & Securities Services grew assets under custody to $16.1 trillion; and Asset Management reported record long-term AUM net inflows of $69 billion. The Firm also continued to strengthen its balance sheet during 2010, ending the year with a Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.8% and a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 12.1%. Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2010, was $176.1 billion. Throughout 2010, JPMorgan Chase continued to support the economic recovery by providing capital, financing and liquidity to its clients in the U.S. and around the world. During the year, the Firm loaned or raised capital of more than $1.4 trillion for its clients, which included more than $10 billion of credit provided to more than 250,000 small businesses in the U.S., an increase of more than 50% over 2009. JPMorgan Chase also made substantial investments in the future of its businesses, including hiring more than 8,000 people in the U.S. alone. The Firm remains committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures. Since the beginning of 2009, the Firm has offered 1,038,000 trial modifications to struggling homeowners. Of the 285,000 modifications that the Firm has completed, more than half were modified under Chase programs, and the remainder were offered under government-sponsored or agency programs. Although the Firm continues to face challenges, there are signs of stability and growth returning to both the global capital markets and the U.S. economy. The Firm intends to continue to innovate and invest in the products that support and serve its clients and the communities where it does business. The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and, for each line of business and the Firm as a whole, includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue on a tax-equivalent basis. Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted accounting guidance that required it to consolidate its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts; as a result, reported and managed basis relating to credit card securitizations are equivalent for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. Prior to the adoption of this accounting guidance, in 2009 and all other prior periods, U.S. GAAP results for CS and the Firm were also adjusted for certain reclassifications that assumed credit card loans that had been securitized and sold by CS remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These adjustments (“managed basis”) had no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see pages 64–66 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2011 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. Economic and macroeconomic factors, such as market and credit trends, customer behavior, client business strategies and competition, are all expected to affect the Firm’s businesses. The outlook for RFS and CS, in particular, reflects the expected effect of current economic trends in the U.S relating to high unemployment levels and the continuing stress and uncertainty in the housing markets. The Firm’s wholesale businesses will be affected by market levels and volumes, which are volatile and quickly subject to change. In the Mortgage Banking, Auto & Other Consumer Lending business within RFS, management expects mortgage fees and related income to be $1 billion or less for the first quarter of 2011, given the levels of mortgage interest rates and production volumes experienced year-to-date. If mortgage interest rates remain at current levels or rise in the future, loan production and margins could continue to be negatively affected resulting in lower revenue for the full year 2011. In addition, revenue could continue to be negatively affected by continued elevated levels of repurchases of mortgages previously sold, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”). Management estimates that realized repurchase losses could total approximately $1.2 billion in 2011. In addition, the Firm is dedicating significant resources to address, correct and enhance its mortgage loan foreclosure procedures and is cooperating with various state and federal investigations into its procedures. As a result, the Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in resolving these issues. In the Real Estate Portfolios business within RFS, management believes that, based on the current outlook for delinquencies and loss severity, it is possible that total quarterly net charge-offs could be approximately $1.2 billion during 2011. Given current origination and production levels, combined with management’s current estimate of portfolio runoff levels, the residential real estate portfolio is expected to decline by approximately 10% to 15% annually for the foreseeable future. The annual reductions in the residential real estate portfolio are expected to reduce net interest income in each period, including a reduction of approximately $700 million in 2011 from the 2010 level; however, over time the reduction in net interest income is expected to be more than offset by an improvement in credit costs and lower expenses. As the portfolio continues to run off, management anticipates that approximately $1.0 billion of capital may become available for redeployment each year, subject to the capital requirements associated with the remaining portfolio. Also, in RFS, management expects noninterest expense in 2011 to remain modestly above 2010 levels, reflecting investments in new branch builds and sales force hires, as well as continued elevated servicing-, default- and foreclosed asset-related costs. In CS, management expects end-of-period outstandings for the Chase portfolio (excluding the Washington Mutual portfolio) to continue to decline in 2011. This decline may be as much as $10 billion in the first quarter, reflecting both continued portfolio run-off and seasonal activity. The decline in the Chase portfolio is expected to bottom out in the third quarter of 2011, and by the end of 2011, outstandings in the portfolio are anticipated to be approximately $120 billion and reflect a better mix of customers. The Washington Mutual portfolio declined to approximately $14 billion at the end of 2010, from $20 billion at the end of 2009. Management estimates that the Washington Mutual portfolio could decline to $10 billion by the end of 2011. The effect of such reductions in the Chase and Washington Mutual portfolios is expected to reduce 2011 net interest income in CS by approximately $1.4 billion from the 2010 level. The net charge-off rates for both the Chase and Washington Mutual credit card portfolios are anticipated to continue to improve. If current delinquency trends continue, the net charge-off rate for the Chase portfolio (excluding the Washington Mutual portfolio) could be below 6.5% in the first quarter of 2011. Despite these positive economic trends, results for RFS and CS will depend on the economic environment. Although the positive economic data seen in 2010 seemed to imply that the U.S. economy was not falling back into recession, high unemployment rates and the difficult housing market have been persistent. Even as consumer lending net charge-offs and delinquencies have improved, the consumer credit portfolio remains under stress. Further declines in U.S. housing prices and increases in the unemployment rate remain possible; if this were to occur, results for both RFS and CS could be adversely affected. In IB, TSS and AM, revenue will be affected by market levels, volumes and volatility, which will influence client flows and assets under management, supervision and custody. In addition, IB and CB results will continue to be affected by the credit environment, which will influence levels of charge-offs, repayments and provision for credit losses. In Private Equity (within the Corporate/Private Equity segment), earnings will likely continue to be volatile and be influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific issues. Corporate’s net interest income levels will generally trend with the size and duration of the investment securities portfolio. Corporate net income (excluding Private Equity, and excluding merger-related items, material litigation expenses and significant nonrecurring items, if any) is anticipated to trend toward a level of approximately $300 million per quarter. Furthermore, continued repositioning of the investment securities portfolio in Corporate could result in modest downward pressure on the Firm’s net interest margin in the first quarter of 2011. Regarding regulatory reform, JPMorgan Chase intends to continue to work with the Firm’s regulators as they proceed with the extensive rulemaking required to implement financial reform. The Firm will continue to devote substantial resources to achieving implementation of regulatory reforms in a way that preserves the value the Firm delivers to its clients. Management and the Firm’s Board of Directors continually evaluate ways to deploy the Firm’s strong capital base in order to enhance shareholder value. Such alternatives could include the repurchase of common stock, increasing the common stock dividend and pursuing alternative investment opportunities. Management and the Board will continue to assess and make decisions regarding these alternatives, as appropriate, over the course of the year. Total net revenue for 2010 was $102.7 billion, up by $2.3 billion, or 2%, from 2009. Results for 2010 were driven by a higher level of securities gains and private equity gains in Corporate/Private Equity, higher asset management fees in AM and administration fees in TSS, and higher other income in several businesses, partially offset by lower credit card income. Investment banking fees decreased from 2009 due to lower equity underwriting and advisory fees, partially offset by higher debt underwriting fees. Competitive markets combined with flat industry-wide equity underwriting and completed M&A volumes, resulted in lower equity underwriting and advisory fees; while strong industry-wide loan syndication and high-yield bond volumes drove record debt underwriting fees in IB. For additional information on investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 69–71 of this Annual Report. Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue from the Firm’s trading and private equity investing activities, increased compared with 2009. This was driven by the Private Equity business, which had significant private equity gains in 2010, compared with a small loss in 2009, reflecting improvements in market conditions. Trading revenue decreased, reflecting lower results in Corporate, offset by higher revenue in IB primarily reflecting gains from the widening of the Firm’s credit spread on certain structured and derivative liabilities. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased in 2010 from 2009 levels, reflecting lower deposit-related fees in RFS associated, in part, with newly-enacted legislation related to non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees; this was partially offset by higher lending-related service fees in IB, primarily from growth in business volume, and in CB, primarily from higher commitment and letter-of-credit fees. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased from 2009. The increase largely reflected higher asset management fees in AM, driven by the effect of higher market levels, net inflows to products with higher margins and higher performance fees; and higher administration fees in TSS, reflecting the effects of higher market levels and net inflows of assets under custody. This increase was partially offset by lower brokerage commissions in IB, as a result of lower market volumes. Securities gains were significantly higher in 2010 compared with 2009, resulting primarily from the repositioning of the portfolio in response to changes in the interest rate environment and to rebalance exposure. Mortgage fees and related income increased in 2010 compared with 2009, driven by higher mortgage production revenue, reflecting increased mortgage origination volumes in RFS and AM, and wider margins, particularly in RFS. This increase was largely offset by higher repurchase losses in RFS (recorded as contra-revenue), which were attributable to higher estimated losses related to repurchase demands, predominantly from GSEs. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS, see RFS’s Mortgage Banking, Auto & Other Consumer Lending discussion on pages 74–77 of this Annual Report. Credit card income decreased during 2010, predominantly due to the impact of the accounting guidance related to VIEs, effective January 1, 2010, that required the Firm to consolidate the assets and liabilities of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. Adoption of the new guidance resulted in the elimination of all servicing fees received from Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts (which was offset by related increases in net interest income and the provision for credit losses, and the elimination of securitization income/(losses) in other income). Lower income from other fee-based products also contributed to the decrease in credit card income. Excluding the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance, credit card income increased in 2010, reflecting higher customer charge volume on credit and debit cards. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on the Consolidated Statements of Income, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 64–66 of this Annual Report. For additional information on credit card income, see the CS and RFS segment results on pages 79–81, and pages 72–78, respectively, of this Annual Report. Other income increased in 2010, largely due to the write-down of securitization interests during 2009 and higher auto operating lease income in RFS. Net interest income was relatively flat in 2010 compared with 2009. The effect of lower loan balances was predominantly offset by the effect of the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to VIEs (which increased net interest income by approximately $5.8 billion in 2010). Excluding the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance, net interest income decreased, driven by lower average loan balances, primarily in CS, RFS and IB, reflecting the continued runoff of the credit card balances and residential real estate loans, and net repayments and loan sales; lower yields and fees on credit card receivables, reflecting the impact of legislative changes; and lower yields on securities in Corporate resulting from investment portfolio repositioning. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $1.7 trillion in 2010, and the net yield on those assets, on a FTE basis, was 3.06%, a decrease of 6 basis points from 2009. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to VIEs on the Consolidated Statements of Income, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 64–66 of this Annual Report. For further information on the impact of the legislative changes on the Consolidated Statements of Income, see CS discussion on Credit Card Legislation on page 79 of this Annual Report.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2010-02-24.@JPMorgan Chase reported 2009 net income of $11.7 billion, or $2.26 per share, compared with net income of $5.6 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2008. Total net revenue in 2009 was $100.4 billion, compared with $67.3 billion in 2008. Return on common equity was 6% in 2009 and 4% in 2008. Results benefited from the impact of the acquisition of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) on September 25, 2008, and the impact of the merger with The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) on May 30, 2008. The increase in net income for the year was driven by record net revenue, including record revenue in the Investment Bank reflecting modest net gains on legacy leveraged-lending and mortgage-related positions compared with net markdowns in the prior year. Partially offsetting the growth in the Firm’s revenue was an increase in the provision for credit losses, driven by an increase in the consumer provision, and higher noninterest expense reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. The business environment in 2009 gradually improved throughout the year. The year began with a continuation of the weak conditions experienced in 2008 - the global economy contracted sharply in the first quarter, labor markets deteriorated rapidly and unemployment rose, credit was tight, liquidity was diminished, and businesses continued to downsize and cut inventory levels rapidly. Throughout the year, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) took actions to stabilize the financial markets and promote an economic revival. It held its policy rate close to zero and indicated that this policy was likely to remain in place for some time, given economic conditions. In addition, it greatly expanded a program it launched at the end of 2008, with a plan to buy up to $1.7 trillion of securities, including Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities and obligations of government-sponsored agencies. The U.S. government and various regulators continued their efforts to stabilize the U.S. economy, putting in place a financial rescue plan that supplemented the interest rate and other actions that had been taken by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) in the second half of 2008. These efforts began to take effect during 2009. Developing economies rebounded significantly and contraction in developed economies slowed. Credit conditions improved in the summer, with most credit spreads narrowing dramatically. By the third quarter of the year, many spreads had returned to pre-crisis levels. By the fourth quarter, economic activity was expanding and signs emerged that the deterioration in the labor market was abating, although by the end of the year unemployment reached 10%, its highest level since 1983. The housing sector showed some signs of improvement and household spending appeared to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remained constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses were continuing to reduce capital investment, though at a slower pace, and remained reluctant to add to payrolls. Financial market conditions in the fourth quarter became more supportive of economic growth. Amidst this difficult operating environment, JPMorgan Chase benefited from the diversity of its leading franchises, as demonstrated by the continued earnings strength of its Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, Asset Management, and Retail Banking franchises. Significant market share and efficiency gains helped all of the Firm’s businesses maintain leadership positions: the Investment Bank ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees for 2009; in Commercial Banking, at year-end 2009, the total revenue related to investment banking products sold to CB clients doubled from its level at the time of the JPMorgan Chase-Bank One merger. In addition, the Firm completed the integration of Washington Mutual and continued to invest in its businesses, demonstrated by growth in checking and credit card accounts. Throughout 2009, the Firm remained focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. In addition to the capital generated from earnings, the Firm issued $5.8 billion of common stock and reduced its quarterly dividend. The Firm also increased its consumer allowance for credit losses by $7.8 billion, bringing the total allowance for credit losses to $32.5 billion, or 5.5% of total loans. The Firm recorded a $1.1 billion one-time noncash adjustment to common stockholders’ equity related to the redemption of the $25.0 billion of Series K Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. Even with this adjustment, the Firm ended 2009 with a very strong Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.1% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.8%. Throughout this turbulent financial period, JPMorgan Chase supported and served its 90 million customers and the communities in which it operates; delivered consumer-friendly products and policies; and continued to lend. The Firm extended nearly $250 billion in new credit to consumers during the year and for its corporate and municipal clients, either lent or assisted them in raising approximately $1 trillion in loans, stocks or bonds. The Firm also remained committed to helping homeowners meet the challenges of declining home prices and rising unemployment. Since 2007, the Firm has initiated over 900,000 actions to prevent foreclosures through its own programs and through government mortgage-modification programs. During 2009 alone, JPMorgan Chase offered approximately 600,000 loan modifications to struggling homeowners. Of these, 89,000 loans have achieved permanent modification. By March 31, 2010, the Firm will have opened 51 Chase Homeownership Centers across the country and already has over 14,000 employees dedicated to mortgage loss mitigation. Management remains confident that JPMorgan Chase’s capital and reserve strength, combined with its significant earnings power, will allow the Firm to meet the uncertainties that lie ahead and still continue investing in its businesses and serving its clients and shareholders over the long term. The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis unless otherwise noted. For more information about managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 50–52 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2010 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment and client activity levels. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm continues to monitor the U.S. and international economies and political environments. The outlook for capital markets remains uncertain, and further declines in U.S. housing prices in certain markets and increases in the unemployment rate, either of which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial results, are possible. In addition, as a result of recent market conditions, the U.S. Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions; any legislation or regulations that may be adopted as a result could limit or restrict the Firm’s operations, and could impose additional costs on the Firm in order to comply with such new laws or rules. Given the potential stress on consumers from rising unemployment and continued downward pressure on housing prices, management remains cautious with respect to the credit outlook for the consumer loan portfolios. Possible continued weakness in credit trends could result in higher credit costs and require additions to the consumer allowance for credit losses. Based on management’s current economic outlook, quarterly net charge-offs could reach $1.4 billion for the home equity portfolio, $600 million for the prime mortgage portfolio and $500 million for the subprime mortgage portfolio over the next several quarters. The managed net charge-off rate for Card Services (excluding the Washington Mutual credit card portfolio) could approach 11% by the first quarter of 2010, including the adverse timing effect of a payment holiday program of approximately 60 basis points. The managed net charge-off rate for the Washington Mutual credit card portfolio could approach 24% over the next several quarters. These charge-off rates are likely to move even higher if the economic environment deteriorates beyond management’s current expectations. Similarly, wholesale credit costs and net charge-offs could increase in the next several quarters if the credit environment deteriorates. The Investment Bank continues to operate in an uncertain environment, and as noted above, results could be adversely affected if the credit environment were to deteriorate further. Trading results can be volatile and 2009 included elevated client volumes and spread levels. As such, management expects Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue to normalize over time as conditions stabilize. In the Retail Banking segment within Retail Financial Services, although management expects underlying growth, results will be under pressure from the credit environment and ongoing lower consumer spending levels. In addition, the Firm has made changes, consistent with (and in certain respects, beyond) the requirements of newly-enacted legislation, in its policies relating to non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees. Although management estimates are, at this point in time, preliminary and subject to change, such changes are expected to result in an annualized reduction in net income of approximately $500 million, beginning in the first quarter of 2010. In the Consumer Lending segment within Retail Financial Services, at current production and estimated run-off levels, the Home Lending portfolio of $263 billion at December 31, 2009, is expected to decline by approximately 10–15% and could possibly average approximately $240 billion in 2010 and approximately $200 billion in 2011. Based on management’s preliminary estimate, which is subject to change, the effect of such a reduction in the Home Lending portfolio is expected to reduce 2010 net interest income in the portfolio by approximately $1 billion from the 2009 level. Additionally, revenue could be negatively affected by elevated levels of repurchases of mortgages previously sold to, for example, government-sponsored enterprises. Management expects noninterest expense in Retail Financial Services to remain at or above 2009 levels, reflecting investments in new branch builds and sales force hires as well as continued elevated servicing, default and foreclosed asset related costs. Card Services faces rising credit costs in 2010, as well as continued pressure on both charge volumes and credit card receivables growth, reflecting continued lower levels of consumer spending. In addition, as a result of the recently-enacted credit card legislation, management estimates, which are preliminary and subject to change, are that CS’s annual net income may be adversely affected by approximately $500 million to $750 million. Further, management expects average Card outstandings to decline by approximately 10-15% in 2010 due to the run-off of the Washington Mutual portfolio and lower balance transfer levels. As a result of all these factors, management currently expects CS to report net losses in each of the first two quarters of 2010 (of approximately $1 billion in the first quarter and somewhat less than that in the second quarter) before the effect of any potential reserve actions. Results in the second half of 2010 will likely be dependent on the economic environment and potential reserve actions. Commercial Banking results could be negatively affected by rising credit costs, a decline in loan demand and reduced liability balances. Earnings in Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management will be affected by the impact of market levels on assets under management, supervision and custody. Additionally, earnings in Treasury & Securities Services could be affected by liability balance flows. Earnings in Private Equity (within the Corporate/Private Equity segment) will likely be volatile and continue to be influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific issues. Corporate’s net interest income levels and securities gains will generally trend with the size of the investment portfolio in Corporate; however, the high level of trading gains in Corporate in the second half of 2009 is not likely to continue. In the near-term, Corporate quarterly net income (excluding Private Equity, merger-related items and any significant nonrecurring items) is expected to decline to approximately $300 million, subject to the size and duration of the investment securities portfolio. Lastly, with regard to any decision by the Firm’s Board of Directors concerning any increase in the level of the common stock dividend, their determination will be subject to their judgment that the likelihood of another severe economic downturn has sufficiently diminished, that overall business performance has stabilized, and that such action is warranted taking into consideration the Firm’s earnings outlook, need to maintain adequate capital levels, alternative investment opportunities, and appropriate dividend payout ratios. When in the Board’s judgment, based on the foregoing, the Board believes it appropriate to increase the dividend to an annual payout level in the range of $0.75 to $1.00 per share, the Board would likely move forward with such an increase, and follow at some later time with an additional increase or additional increases sufficient to return to the Firm’s historical dividend ratio of approximately 30% to 40% of normalized earnings over time. Total net revenue was $100.4 billion, up by $33.2 billion, or 49%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions revenue, primarily related to improved performance across most fixed income and equity products, and the absence of net markdowns on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage positions in IB, as well as higher levels of trading gains and investment securities income in Corporate/Private Equity. Results also benefited from the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, which contributed to increases in net interest income, lending- and deposit-related fees, and mortgage fees and related income. Lastly, higher investment banking fees also contributed to revenue growth. These increases in revenue were offset partially by reduced fees and commissions from the effect of lower market levels on assets under management and custody, and the absence of proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering in the first quarter of 2008. Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue from trading and private equity investing activities, was significantly higher compared with the prior year. Trading revenue increased, driven by improved performance across most fixed income and equity products; modest net gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions, compared with net markdowns of $10.6 billion in the prior year; and gains on trading positions in Corporate/Private Equity, compared with losses in the prior year of $1.1 billion on markdowns of Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) preferred securities. These increases in revenue were offset partially by an aggregate loss of $2.3 billion from the tightening of the Firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities and derivatives, compared with gains of $2.0 billion in the prior year from widening spreads on these liabilities and derivatives. The Firm’s private equity investments produced a slight net loss in 2009, a significant improvement from a larger net loss in 2008. The decline in asset management, administration and commissions revenue compared with the prior year was largely due to lower asset management fees in AM from the effect of lower market levels. Also contributing to the decrease were lower administration fees in TSS, driven by the effect of market depreciation on certain custody assets and lower securities lending balances; and lower brokerage commissions revenue in IB, predominantly related to lower transaction volume  Securities gains were lower in 2009 and included credit losses related to other-than-temporary impairment and lower gains on the sale of MasterCard shares of $241 million in 2009, compared with $668 million in 2008. These decreases were offset partially by higher gains from repositioning the Corporate investment securities portfolio in connection with managing the Firm’s structural interest rate risk. Mortgage fees and related income increased slightly from the prior year, as higher net mortgage servicing revenue was largely offset by lower production revenue. The increase in net mortgage servicing revenue was driven by growth in average third-party loans serviced as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction. Mortgage production revenue declined from the prior year, reflecting an increase in estimated losses from the repurchase of previously-sold loans, offset partially by wider margins on new originations. For a discussion of mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS’s Consumer Lending business, see the Consumer Lending discussion on pages 60–63 of this Annual Report.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2009-03-02.@JPMorgan Chase reported 2008 net income of $5.6 billion, or $1.37 per share, and total net revenue of $67.3 billion, compared with record net income of $15.4 billion, or $4.38 per share, and record total net revenue of $71.4 billion, for 2007. Return on common equity was 4% in 2008, compared with 13% in 2007. Results in 2008 include the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (“Bear Stearns”) on May 30, 2008, and the acquisition of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) on September 25, 2008. The decline in net income for the year was the result of a significantly higher provision for credit losses, reflecting the addition of $13.7 billion to the Firm’s allowance for credit losses in 2008; a decline in total net revenue driven by over $10 billion of markdowns on mortgage-related positions and leveraged lending exposures in the Investment Bank; and an increase in total noninterest expense due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and the Bear Stearns merger. The business environment for financial services firms was extremely challenging in 2008. The global economy slowed, with many countries, including the U.S., slipping into recession. Financial conditions worsened throughout the year amid a number of unprecedented developments that undermined the economic outlook and eroded confidence in global financial markets. JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns through a merger consummated in May and acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in September. The U.S. federal government placed the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) under its control. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. declared bankruptcy. The Bank of America Corporation acquired Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and Wells Fargo & Company acquired Wachovia Corporation. The government provided a loan to American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) in exchange for an equity interest in AIG to prevent the insurer’s failure. Morgan Stanley, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., GMAC, American Express, Discover Financial Services and CIT Group received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) to become federal bank holding companies. In other industries, the U.S. government provided temporary loans to General Motors Corporation and Chrysler LLC. These events accompanied severe strains in term funding markets, reflecting heightened concerns about counterparty risk. As a result, LIBOR rates rose significantly in the fall, despite a round of coordinated rate cuts by a number of central banks. By year-end, LIBOR rates eased in response to proposals to insure deposits and selected debt of financial institutions. The turmoil in financial markets during 2008 led to tighter credit conditions and diminished liquidity, causing consumers and businesses around the world to become more cautious and curtail spending and investment activity. As a result, the U.S. economy contracted sharply, 2.8 million jobs were lost in 2008, and the U.S. unemployment rate rose significantly, to 7.2% by year-end. The continued economic and financial disruption led the Federal Reserve to reduce its target overnight interest rates to near zero in the fourth quarter of 2008, capping off a year of near-continuous rate reductions. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”), the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, working in cooperation with foreign governments and other central banks, including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, began, in the fourth quarter of 2008, to take a variety of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets and strengthen financial institutions, including capital injections, guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from banks. In particular, on October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to take a range of actions to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions (the “Troubled Asset Relief Program”) and the direct purchase by the U.S. Treasury of equity of financial institutions (the “Capital Purchase Program”). The efforts to restore confidence in the financial markets and promote economic growth continue in 2009, with initiatives including a fiscal stimulus bill, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009. Also in February, the U.S. Treasury outlined a plan to restore stability to the financial system and President Obama proposed a plan to help distressed homeowners. The Federal Reserve, working with other government and regulatory agencies, has also implemented a number of new programs to promote the proper functioning of the credit markets and reintroduce liquidity to the financial system. Such actions taken by U.S. regulatory agencies include the introduction of programs to restore liquidity to money market mutual funds, the commercial paper market, and other fixed-income securities markets. In addition, the FDIC issued a temporary liquidity guarantee program (the “TLG Program”) for the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions, as well as deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction deposit accounts. Despite the difficult operating environment and overall drop in earnings, JPMorgan Chase maintained a strong balance sheet and produced underlying growth in many business areas. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.9% at year-end; Treasury & Securities Services and Commercial Banking each reported record revenue and net income for the second straight year; the consumer businesses opened millions of new checking and credit card accounts; Asset Management experienced record net inflows in assets under management; and the Investment Bank gained market share in all major fee categories. The diversified nature of the Firm’s businesses and its strong capital position enabled it to weather the recessionary environment during 2008. JPMorgan Chase has taken a leadership role in helping to stabilize the financial markets. It assumed the risk and expended the necessary resources to acquire Bear Stearns and the banking operations of Washington Mutual. In October 2008, the Firm agreed to accept a $25 billion capital investment by the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. JPMorgan Chase has continued to lend to clients in a safe and sound manner and to provide liquidity to multiple financial markets. The Firm has implemented programs that have prevented more than 300,000 foreclosures, with plans to help more than 400,000 more families keep their homes through Chase-owned mortgage modifications over the next two years. The Firm has expanded this effort to include over $1.1 trillion of investor-owned mortgages. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2009 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment and client activity levels. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. In addition, as a result of recent market conditions and events, Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. The Firm’s current expectations are for the global and U.S. economic environments to weaken further and potentially faster, capital markets to remain under stress, for there to be a continued decline in U.S. housing prices, and for Congress and regulators to continue to adopt legislation and regulations that could limit or restrict the Firm’s operations, or impose additional costs upon the Firm in order to comply with such new laws or rules. These factors are likely to continue to adversely impact the Firm’s revenue, credit costs, overall business volumes and earnings. Given the potential stress on the consumer from rising unemployment, the continued downward pressure on housing prices and the elevated national inventory of unsold homes, management remains extremely cautious with respect to the credit outlook for home equity, mortgage and credit card portfolios. Management expects continued deterioration in credit trends for the home equity, mortgage and credit card portfolios, which will likely require additions to the consumer loan loss allowance in 2009 or beyond. Economic data released in early 2009 indicated that housing prices and the labor market have weakened further since year-end, and that deterioration could continue into late 2009. Based on management’s current economic outlook, quarterly net charge-offs could, over the next several quarters, reach $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion for the home equity portfolio, $375 million to $475 million for the prime mortgage portfolio, and $375 million to $475 million for the subprime mortgage portfolio. Management expects the managed net charge-off rate for Card Services (excluding the impact resulting from the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations) to approach 7% in the first quarter of 2009 and likely higher by the end of the year depending on unemployment levels. These charge-off rates could increase even further if the economic environment continues to deteriorate further than management’s current expectations. The wholesale provision for credit losses and nonperforming assets are likely to increase over time as a result of the deterioration in underlying credit conditions. Wholesale net charge-offs in 2008 increased from historic lows in 2007 and are likely to increase materially in 2009 as a result of increasing weakness in the credit environment. The Investment Bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets, as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity. The continuation of these factors could potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity, lower investment banking fees and lower trading revenue. In addition, if the Firm’s own credit spreads tighten, as they did in the fourth quarter of 2008, the change in the fair value of certain trading liabilities would also negatively affect trading results. The Firm held $12.6 billion (gross notional) of legacy leveraged loans and unfunded commitments as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2008. Markdowns averaging 45% of the gross notional value have been taken on these legacy positions as of December 31, 2008, resulting in a net carrying value of $6.9 billion. Leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively, and if market conditions further deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary on this asset class. The Investment Bank also held, at December 31, 2008, an aggregate $6.1 billion of prime and Alt-A mortgage exposure, which is also difficult to hedge effectively, and $875 million of subprime mortgage exposure. In addition, the Investment Bank had $7.7 billion of commercial mortgage exposure. In spite of active hedging, mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by worsening market conditions and further deterioration in the housing market. The combination of credit costs and additional markdowns on the various exposures noted above could reach or exceed $2.0 billion for the first quarter of 2009. Earnings in Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services could decline due to the impact of tighter spreads in the low interest rate environment or a decline in the level of liability balances. Earnings in Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management will likely deteriorate if market levels continue to decline, due to reduced levels of assets under management, supervision and custody. Earnings in the Corporate/Private Equity segment could be more volatile due to increases in the size of the Firm’s investment portfolio, which is largely comprised of investment-grade securities. Private Equity results are dependent upon the capital markets and at current market levels, management believes additional write-downs of $400 million or more are likely in the first quarter of 2009. Assuming economic conditions do not worsen beyond management’s current expectations, management continues to believe that the net income impact of the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations could be approximately $0.50 per share in 2009; the Bear Stearns merger could contribute $1 billion (after-tax) annualized after 2009; and merger-related items, which include both the Washington Mutual transaction and the Bear Stearns merger, could be approximately $600 million (after-tax) in 2009. Total net revenue of $67.3 billion was down $4.1 billion, or 6%, from the prior year. The decline resulted from the extremely challenging business environment for financial services firms in 2008. Principal transactions revenue decreased significantly and included net markdowns on mortgage-related positions and leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments, losses on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and losses on private equity investments. Also contributing to the decline in total net revenue were other losses and markdowns recorded in other income, including the Firm’s share of Bear Stearns’ losses from April 8 to May 30, 2008. These declines were largely offset by higher net interest income, proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering, and the gain on the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture. Investment banking fees were down from the record level of the prior year due to lower debt underwriting fees, as well as lower advisory and equity underwriting fees, both of which were at record levels in 2007. These declines were attributable to reduced market activity. For a further discussion of investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 42–44 of this Annual Report. In 2008, principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue from the Firm’s trading and private equity investing activities, declined by $19.7 billion from the prior year. Trading revenue decreased $14.5 billion to a negative $9.8 billion compared with a positive $4.7 billion in 2007. The decline in trading revenue was largely driven by higher net markdowns of $5.9 billion on mortgage-related exposures compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year; higher net markdowns of $4.7 billion on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year; losses of $1.1 billion on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and weaker equity trading results compared with a record level in 2007. In addition, trading revenue was adversely impacted by the Bear Stearns merger. Partially offsetting the decline in trading revenue were record results in rates and currencies, credit trading, commodities and emerging markets, as well as strong equity client revenue across products and total gains of $2.0 billion from the widening of the Firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities and derivatives, compared with $1.3 billion in 2007. Private equity results also declined substantially from the prior year, swinging to losses of $908 million in 2008 from gains of $4.3 billion in 2007. In addition, the first quarter of 2007 included a fair value adjustment related to the adoption of SFAS 157. Lending & deposit-related fees rose from the prior year, predominantly resulting from higher deposit-related fees and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. For a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in RFS, TSS and CB. The decline in asset management, administration and commissions revenue compared with 2007 was driven by lower asset management fees in AM due to lower performance fees and the effect of lower markets on assets under management. This decline was partially offset by an increase in commissions revenue related predominantly to higher brokerage transaction volume within IB’s equity markets revenue, which included additions from Bear Stearns’ Prime Services business; and higher administration fees in TSS driven by wider spreads in securities lending and increased product usage by new and existing clients. The increase in securities gains compared with the prior year was due to the repositioning of the Corporate investment securities portfolio as a result of lower interest rates as part of managing the structural interest rate risk of the Firm, and higher gains from the sale of MasterCard shares. For a further discussion of securities gains, which are mostly recorded in the Firm’s Corporate business. Mortgage fees and related income increased from the prior year, driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue, which benefited from an improvement in MSR risk management results and increased loan servicing revenue. Mortgage production revenue increased slightly, as the impact of growth in originations was predominantly offset by markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and increased reserves related to the repurchase of previously sold loans. For a discussion of mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS’ Consumer Lending business, see the Consumer Lending discussion on pages 47–50 of this Annual Report. Credit card income rose compared with the prior year, driven by increased interchange income due to higher customer charge volume in CS and higher debit card transaction volume in RFS, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, and increased servicing fees resulting from a higher level of securitized receivables. These results were partially offset by increases in volume-driven payments to partners and expense related to rewards programs. For a further discussion of credit card income, see CS’ segment results on pages 51–53 of this Annual Report. Other income increased compared with the prior year, due predominantly to the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering of $1.5 billion, the gain on the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture of $1.0 billion, and gains on sales of certain other assets. These proceeds and gains were partially offset by markdowns on certain investments, including seed capital in AM; a $464 million charge related to the offer to repurchase auction-rate securities at par; losses of $423 million reflecting the Firm’s 49.4% ownership in Bear Stearns’ losses from April 8 to May 30, 2008; and lower securitization income at CS. Net interest income rose from the prior year, due predominantly to the following: higher trading-related net interest income in IB, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider net interest spread in Corporate/Private Equity, growth in liability and deposit balances in the wholesale and RFS businesses, higher consumer and wholesale loan balances, and wider spreads on consumer loans in RFS. The Firm’s total average interest-earning assets for 2008 were $1.4 trillion, up 23% from the prior year, driven by higher loans, AFS securities, securities borrowed, brokerage receivables and other interest-earning assets balances. The Firm’s total average interest-bearing liabilities for 2008 were $1.3 trillion, up 24% from the prior year, driven by higher deposits, long-term debt, brokerage payables and other borrowings balances.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2008-02-29.@JPMorgan Chase reported record Net income and record Total net revenue in 2007, exceeding the record levels achieved in 2006. Net income in 2007 was $15.4 billion, or $4.38 per share, and Total net revenue was $71.4 billion, compared with Net income of $14.4 billion, or $4.04 per share, and Total net revenue of $62.0 billion for 2006. The return on common equity was 13% in both years. Reported results in 2006 included $795 million of income from discontinued operations related to the exchange of selected corporate trust businesses for the consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank of New York. Income from continuing operations in 2006 was $13.6 billion, or $3.82 per share. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s consolidated results of operations, see pages 31–35 of this Annual Report. The Firm’s results over the past several years have benefited from growth in the global economy and, most importantly, from the management team’s focus on driving organic revenue growth and improving operating margins by investing in each line of business, reducing waste, efficiently using the Firm’s balance sheet and successfully completing the integration plan for the merger of Bank One Corporation with and into JPMorgan Chase on July 1, 2004 (“the Merger”). The success in executing on this agenda in 2007 is reflected in the strong organic growth experienced by all of our businesses including: record levels of advisory fees, equity underwriting fees and equity markets revenue; double-digit revenue growth in Retail Financial Services, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management; and improved operating margins in most businesses. This improved performance was driven by growth in key business metrics including: double-digit growth in deposit and loan balances; 127 new branches and 680 additional ATMs; 15% growth in assets under custody; $115 billion of net assets under management inflows; 16 million new credit card accounts with 1.4 million sold in branches; and nearly doubling real estate mortgage origination market share to 11% during the fourth quarter of 2007. At the same time the Firm increased loan loss reserve levels, and maintained strong capital ratios and ample levels of liquidity as part of its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2007, the Firm also continued to create a stronger infrastructure. The Firm successfully completed the in-sourcing of its credit card processing platform, which will allow for faster introduction of new and enhanced products and services. In addition, with the successful completion of the systems conversion and rebranding for 339 former Bank of New York branches and the conversion of the wholesale deposit system (the last significant Merger event which affected more than $180 billion in customer balances), the Firm’s consumer and wholesale customers throughout the U.S. now have access to over 3,100 branches and 9,100 ATMs in 17 states, all of which are on common computer systems. With Merger integration activity completed by the end of 2007, the Firm fully realized its established merger-related expense savings target of $3.0 billion. To achieve these merger-related savings, the Firm expensed Merger costs of $209 million during 2007, bringing the total cumulative amount expensed since the Merger announcement to approximately $3.6 billion (including costs associated with the Bank of New York transaction and capitalized costs). With the completion of all Merger integration activity, no further Merger costs will be incurred. In 2007, the global economy continued to expand and inflation remained well-contained despite ongoing price pressures on energy and agricultural commodities. Developing economies maintained strong momentum throughout the year, but the industrial economies slowed in the second half of the year in response to weak housing conditions, monetary tightening by several central banks, rising petroleum prices and tightening credit conditions. The U.S. housing market for the first time in decades experienced a decline in average home prices with some specific markets declining by double-digit percentages. Despite the slowdown in the industrial economies, labor markets remained relatively healthy, supporting ongoing solid, though slowing consumer spending. Substantial financial losses related to U.S. subprime mortgage loans triggered a flight to quality in global financial markets late in the summer. In addition, during the second half of the year, pressures in interbank funding markets increased, credit spreads widened significantly and credit was difficult to obtain for some less creditworthy wholesale and consumer borrowers. Central banks took a number of actions to counter pressures in funding markets, including reducing interest rates and suspending further tightening actions. Capital markets activity increased significantly in the first half of 2007, but declined over the second half of the year amid difficult mortgage and credit market conditions. Despite the volatility in capital markets activity, U.S. and international equity markets performance was strong, with the U.S. stock market reaching an all-time record in October; however, the stock market pulled back from the record level by the end of the year. The S&P 500 and international indices were up, on average, approximately 8% during 2007. The Firm’s improved performance in 2007 benefited both from the investments made in each business and the overall global economic environment. The continued overall expansion of the U.S. and global economies, overall increased level of capital markets activity and positive performance in equity markets helped to drive new business volume and organic growth within each of the Firm’s businesses. These benefits were tempered by the capital markets environment in the second half of the year and the continued weakness in the U.S. housing market. The Investment Bank’s lower results were significantly affected by the uncertain and extremely volatile capital markets environment, which resulted in significant markdowns on leveraged lending, subprime positions and securitized products. Retail Financial Services reported lower earnings, reflecting an increase in the Provision for credit losses and higher net charge-offs for the home equity and subprime mortgage loan portfolios related to the weak housing market. Card Services earnings also decreased driven by an increased Provision for credit losses, reflecting a higher level of net charge-offs. The other lines of business each posted improved results versus 2006. Asset Management, Treasury & Securities Services and Commercial Banking reported record revenue and earnings in 2007, and Private Equity posted very strong results. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2008 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies (which currently are extremely volatile), financial markets activity (including interest rate movements), the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment and client activity levels. Each of these linked factors will affect the performance of the Firm’s lines of business. The Firm currently anticipates a lower level of growth globally and in the U.S. during 2008 and increased credit costs in all businesses. The slower the growth is, or the weaker the economic conditions are, compared with current forecasts, the more the Firm’s financial results could be adversely affected. The consumer Provision for credit losses could increase substantially as a result of a higher level of losses in Retail Financial Services’ $94.8 billion home equity loan portfolio and growth and increased losses in the $15.5 billion retained subprime mortgage loan portfolio. Given the potential stress on the consumer from continued downward pressure on housing prices and the elevated inventory of unsold houses nationally, management remains extremely cautious with respect to the home equity and subprime mortgage portfolios. Economic data released in early 2008, including continued declines in housing prices and increasing unemployment, indicate that losses will likely continue to rise in the home equity portfolio. In addition, the consumer provision could increase due to a higher level of net charge-offs in Card Services. Based on management’s current economic outlook, home equity losses for the first quarter of 2008 could be approximately $450 million and net charge-offs could potentially double from this level by the fourth quarter of 2008, and the net charge-off rate for Card Services could potentially increase to approximately 4.50% of managed loans in the first half of 2008 and to approximately 5.00% by the end of 2008. Net charge-offs for home equity and card services could be higher than management’s current expectations depending on such factors as changes in housing prices, unemployment levels and consumer behavior. The wholesale Provision for credit losses may also increase over time as a result of loan growth, portfolio activity and changes in underlying credit conditions. The Investment Bank enters 2008 with the capital markets still being affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets, as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads, all of which could potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity, difficulty in syndicating leveraged loans, lower investment banking fees and lower trading revenue. While some leveraged finance loans were sold during the fourth quarter of 2007, the Firm held $26.4 billion of leveraged loans and unfunded commitments as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2007. Markdowns in excess of 6% have been taken on the leveraged lending positions as of year-end 2007. These positions are difficult to hedge effectively and as market conditions have continued to deteriorate in the first quarter of 2008, it is likely there will be further markdowns on this asset class. In January 2008, the Firm decided, based on its view of potential relative returns, to retain for investment $4.9 billion of the leveraged lending portfolio that had been previously held-for-sale. The Investment Bank also held, at year end, an aggregate $2.7 billion of subprime CDOs and other subprime-related exposures which could also be negatively affected by market conditions during 2008. While these positions are substantially hedged (none of the hedges include insurance from monoline insurance companies), there can be no assurance that the Firm will not incur additional losses on these positions, as these markets are illiquid and further writedowns may be necessary. Other exposures as of December 31, 2007 that have higher levels of risk given the current market environment include CDO warehouse and trading positions of $5.5 billion (over 90% corporate loans and bonds); Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (“CMBS”) exposure of $15.5 billion; and $6.4 billion of Alt-A mortgage positions. A weaker economy and lower equity markets in 2008 would also adversely affect business volumes, assets under custody and assets under management in Asset Management and Treasury & Securities Services. Management continues to believe that the net loss in Treasury and Other Corporate on a combined basis will be approximately $50 million to $100 million per quarter over time. Private equity results, which are dependent upon the capital markets, could continue to be volatile and may be significantly lower in 2008 than in 2007. For the first quarter of 2008, private equity gains are expected to be minimal. Total net revenue of $71.4 billion was up $9.4 billion, or 15%, from the prior year. Higher Net interest income, very strong private equity gains, record Asset management, administration and commissions revenue, higher Mortgage fees and related income and record Investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth. These increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue. Investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the previous record set in 2006. Record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results, partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees. For a further discussion of Investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded in IB, see the IB segment results on pages 40–42 of this Annual Report. Principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains. Trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level, primarily due to markdowns in IB of $1.4 billion (net of hedges) on subprime positions, including subprime CDOs, and $1.3 billion (net of fees) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments. Also in IB, markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities. Equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products. IB’s Credit Portfolio results increased compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities. The increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains, the classification of certain private equity carried interest as Compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of SFAS 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”). For a further discussion of Principal transactions revenue, see the IB and Corporate segment results on pages 40–42 and 59–60, respectively, and Note 6 on page 122 of this Annual Report. Lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level, driven primarily by higher deposit-related fees and the Bank of New York transaction. For a further discussion of Lending & deposit-related fees, which are mostly recorded in RFS, TSS and CB, see the RFS segment results on pages 43–48, the TSS segment results on pages 54–55, and the CB segment results on pages 52–53 of this Annual Report. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006. Increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in AM drove the record results. The 18% growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments: Institutional, Retail, Private Bank and Private Client Services. TSS also contributed to the rise in Asset management, administration and commissions revenue, driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody. Finally, commissions revenue increased, due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume (primarily included within Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue of IB), which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by RFS in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities. The favorable variance resulting from Securities gains in 2007 compared with Securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the Treasury investment securities portfolio. Also contributing to the positive variance was a $234 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares. Mortgage fees and related income increased from the prior year as mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset valuation adjustments and growth in third-party mortgage loans serviced drove an increase in net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue also grew, as an increase in mortgage loan originations and the classification of certain loan origination costs as expense (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue commenced being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159) more than offset markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline. For a discussion of Mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS’s Mortgage Banking business, see the Mortgage Banking discussion on pages 46–47 of this Annual Report. Credit card income remained relatively unchanged from the 2006 level, as lower servicing fees earned in connection with securitization activities, which were affected unfavorably by higher net credit losses and narrower loan margins, were offset by increases in net interchange income earned on the Firm’s credit and debit cards. For further discussion of Credit card income, see CS’s segment results on pages 49–51 of this Annual Report. Other income declined compared with the prior year, driven by lower gains from loan sales and workouts, and the absence of a $103 million gain in the second quarter of 2006 related to the sale of MasterCard shares in its initial public offering. (The 2007 gain on the sale of MasterCard shares was recorded in Securities gains (losses) as the shares were transferred to the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio subsequent to the IPO.) Increased income from automobile operating leases and higher gains on the sale of leveraged leases and education loans partially offset the decline. Net interest income rose from the prior year, primarily due to the following: higher trading-related Net interest income, due to a shift of Interest expense to Principal transactions revenue (related to certain IB structured notes to which fair value accounting was elected in connection with the adoption of SFAS 159); growth in liability and deposit balances in the wholesale and consumer businesses; a higher level of credit card loans; the impact of the Bank of New York transaction; and an improvement in Treasury’s net interest spread. These benefits were offset partly by a shift to narrower-spread deposit and liability products. The Firm’s total average interest-earning assets for 2007 were $1.1 trillion, up 12% from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher Trading assets – debt instruments, Loans, and AFS securities, partially offset by a decline in Interests in purchased receivables as a result of the restructuring and deconsolidation during the second quarter of 2006 of certain multi-seller conduits that the Firm administered. The net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 2.39%, an increase of 23 basis points from the prior year, due in part to the adoption of SFAS 159.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2007-03-01.@The Firm reported record 2006 net income of $14.4 billion, or $4.04 per share, compared with net income of $8.5 billion, or $2.38 per share, for 2005. The return on common equity was 13% compared with 8% in 2005. Reported results include discontinued operations related to the exchange of selected corporate trust businesses for the consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank of New York. Discontinued operations produced $795 million of net income in 2006 compared with $229 million in the prior year. The primary driver of the increase was a one-time gain of $622 million related to the sale of the corporate trust business (for further information on discontinued operations see Note 3 on page 97 of this Annual Report). Income from continuing operations was a record $13.6 billion, or $3.82 per share, compared with $8.3 billion, or $2.32 per share, for 2005. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s consolidated results of operations, see pages 28–31 of this Annual Report. Effective December 31, 2006, William B. Harrison, Jr. retired as Chairman of the Board and was succeeded as Chairman by Chief Executive Officer James Dimon. The Firm’s record 2006 results were affected positively by global economic conditions, investment in each line of business and the successful completion of milestones in the execution of its Merger integration plan. A key milestone related to the Merger integration was the New York Tri-state consumer conversion, which linked the Firm’s more than 2,600 branches in 17 states on a common systems platform (excluding 339 branches acquired from The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006). The Tri-state conversion, along with many other merger integration activities, resulted in continued efficiencies. As a result the Firm made significant progress toward reaching its annual merger-related savings target of approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. The Firm realized approximately $675 million of incremental merger savings in 2006, bringing estimated cumulative savings for 2006 to $2.5 billion, and the annualized run-rate of savings entering 2007 is approximately $2.8 billion. In order to achieve these savings, the Firm expensed Merger costs of $305 million during the year (including a modest amount of costs related to The Bank of New York transaction), bringing the total cumulative amount expensed since the Merger announcement to approximately $3.4 billion (including capitalized costs). Management currently estimates remaining Merger costs of approximately $400 million, which are expected to be incurred during 2007 and will include a modest amount of expense related to the acquisition of The Bank of New York’s consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses. The Firm also continued active management of its portfolio of businesses during 2006. Actions included: exchanging selected corporate trust businesses for the consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank of New York; divesting the insurance underwriting business; purchasing Collegiate Funding Services to develop further the education finance business; acquiring Kohl’s private-label credit card portfolio; acquiring the middle and back office operations of Paloma Partners to expand the Firm’s hedge fund administration capabilities; and announcing a strategic alliance with Fidelity Brokerage to provide new issue equity and fixed income products. In 2006, the global economy continued to expand, which supported continued rapid growth in the emerging market economies. Global gross domestic product increased by an estimated 5%, with the European economy gaining momentum, Japan making steady progress and emerging Asian economies expanding approximately 8%. The U.S. economy rebounded early in the year from the prior-year hurricane disruptions, but weakened in the second half of the year as home construction declined, automobile manufacturing weakened and the benefit of reconstruction from hurricane disruptions dissipated. The U.S. experienced rising interest rates during the first half of the year, as the Federal Reserve Board increased the federal funds rate from 4.25% to 5.25%. With an anticipated slowing of economic growth, lower inflation and stabilizing energy prices, the federal funds rate was held steady during the second half of the year. The yield curve subsequently inverted as receding inflation expectations pushed long-term interest rates below the federal funds rate. Equity markets, both domestic and international, reflected positive performance, with the S&P 500 up 13% on average and international indices increasing 16% on average during 2006. Global capital markets activity was strong during 2006, with debt and equity underwriting and merger and acquisition activity surpassing 2005 levels. Demand for wholesale loans in the U.S. was strong with growth of approximately 14%, while U.S. consumer loans grew an estimated 4% during 2006. U.S. consumer spending grew at a solid pace, supported by strong equity markets, low unemployment and income growth, and lower energy prices in the second half of the year. This strength came despite a significant decline in real estate appreciation. The 2006 economic environment was a contributing factor to the performance of the Firm and each of its businesses. The overall economic expansion, strong level of capital markets activity and positive performance in equity markets helped to drive new business volume and organic growth within each of the Firm’s businesses while also contributing to the stable credit quality within the loan portfolio. However, the interest rate environment affected negatively wholesale loan spread and consumer loan and deposit spreads. Spreads related to wholesale liabilities widened compared with the prior year, but this benefit declined over the course of 2006. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2007 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global economy, financial markets activity and the geopolitical environment, all of which are linked integrally. While the Firm considers outcomes for, and has contingency plans to respond to, stress environments, the basic outlook for 2007 is predicated on the interest rate movements implied in the forward rate curve for U.S. Treasury securities, the continuation of favorable U.S. and international equity markets and continued expansion of the global economy. The Investment Bank enters 2007 with a strong investment banking fee pipeline and remains focused on developing new products and capabilities. Asset Management anticipates growth driven by continued net asset inflows. Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services expect growth due to increased business activity and product sales with some competitive and rate pressures. However, the performance of the Firm’s wholesale businesses will be affected by overall global economic growth and by financial market movements and activity levels in any given period. Retail Financial Services anticipates benefiting from the continued expansion of the branch network and sales force, including the addition of The Bank of New York’s 339 branches, and improved sales productivity and cross-selling in the branches. Loan and deposit spreads are expected to experience continued compression due to the interest rate and competitive environments. Card Services anticipates growth in managed receivables and sales volume, both of which are expected to benefit from marketing initiatives and new partnerships. Expenditures on marketing are expected to be lower than the 2006 level. In the Corporate segment, the revenue outlook for the Private Equity business is directly related to the strength of the equity markets and the performance of the underlying portfolio investments. If current market conditions persist, the Firm anticipates continued realization of private equity gains in 2007, but results can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Management believes that the net loss in Treasury and Other Corporate, on a combined basis, will be approximately $50 to $100 million per quarter in 2007, reflecting merger savings and other expense efficiency initiatives, such as less excess real estate. The Provision for credit losses in 2007 is anticipated to be higher than in 2006, primarily driven by a trend toward a more normal level of provisioning for credit losses in both the wholesale and consumer businesses. The consumer Provision for credit losses should reflect a higher level of net charge-offs as bankruptcy filings continue to increase from the significantly lower than normal levels experienced in 2006 related to the change in bankruptcy law in 2005. Firmwide expenses are anticipated to reflect investments in each business, continued merger savings and other operating efficiencies. Annual Merger savings are expected to reach approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007, upon the completion of the last significant conversion activity, the wholesale deposit conversion scheduled for the second half of 2007. Offsetting merger savings will be continued investment in distribution enhancements and new product offerings, and expenses related to recent acquisitions including The Bank of New York transaction. Merger costs of approximately $400 million are expected to be incurred during 2007 (including a modest amount related to The Bank of New York transaction). These additions are expected to bring total cumulative merger costs to $3.8 billion by the end of 2007. otal net revenue for 2006 was $61.4 billion, up by $7.7 billion, or 14%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher Principal transactions, primarily from strong trading revenue results, record Asset management, administration and commissions revenue, and record Investment banking fees. Also contributing to the increase was higher Net interest income and lower securities portfolio losses. These improvements were offset partially by a decline in Other income partly as a result of the gain recognized in 2005 on the sale of BrownCo, and lower Mortgage fees and related income. The increase in Investment banking fees was driven by record debt and equity underwriting as well as strong advisory fees. For a further discussion of Investment banking fees, which are recorded primarily in the IB, see the IB segment results on pages 36–37 of this Annual Report. Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities, including physical commodities inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value, primarily in the IB, and Private equity gains and losses, primarily in the private equity business of Corporate. Trading revenue increased compared with 2005 due to record performance in Equity and Fixed income markets. For a further discussion of Principal transactions revenue, see the IB and Corporate segment results on pages 36–37 and 53–54, respectively, of this Annual Report. Lending & deposit related fees rose slightly in comparison with 2005 as a result of higher fee income on deposit-related fees and, in part, from The Bank of New York transaction. For a further discussion of the change in Lending & deposit related fees, which are recorded in RFS, see the RFS segment results on pages 38–42 of this Annual Report. The increase in Asset management, administration and commissions revenue in 2006 was driven by growth in assets under management in AM, which exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2006, higher equity-related commissions in IB and higher performance and placement fees. The growth in assets under management reflected net asset inflows in the institutional and retail segments. Also contributing to the increase were higher assets under custody in TSS driven by market value appreciation and new business; and growth in depositary receipts, securities lending and global clearing, all of which were driven by a combination of increased product usage by existing clients and new business. In addition, commissions in the IB rose as a result of strength across regions, partly offset by the sale of the insurance business and BrownCo. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for AM on pages 50–52, TSS on pages 48–49 and RFS on pages 38–42, of this Annual Report. The favorable variance in Securities gains (losses) was due primarily to lower Securities losses in Treasury in 2006 from portfolio repositioning activities in connection with the management of the Firm’s assets and liabilities. For a further discussion of Securities gains (losses), which are mostly recorded in the Firm’s Treasury business, see the Corporate segment discussion on pages 53–54 of this Annual Report. Mortgage fees and related income declined in comparison with 2005 reflecting a reduction in net mortgage servicing revenue and higher losses on mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale. These declines were offset partly by growth in production revenue as a result of higher volume of loans sales and wider gain on sale margins. Mortgage fees and related income exclude the impact of NII and AFS securities gains related to mortgage activities. For a discussion of Mortgage fees and related income, which is recorded primarily in RFS’s Mortgage Banking business, see the Mortgage Banking discussion on page 41 of this Annual Report. Credit card income increased from 2005, primarily from higher customer charge volume that favorably impacted interchange income and servicing fees earned in connection with securitization activities, which benefited from lower credit losses incurred on securitized credit card loans. These increases were offset partially by increases in volume-driven payments to partners, expenses related to reward programs, and interest paid to investors in the securitized loans. Credit card income also was impacted negatively by the deconsolida-tion of Paymentech in the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in Other income compared with the prior year was due to a $1.3 billion pretax gain recognized in 2005 on the sale of BrownCo and lower gains from loan workouts. Partially offsetting these two items were higher automobile operating lease revenue; an increase in equity investment income, in particular, from Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC; and a pretax gain of $103 million on the sale of MasterCard shares in its initial public offering. Net interest income rose due largely to improvement in Treasury’s net interest spread and increases in wholesale liability balances, wholesale and consumer loans, available-for-sale securities, and consumer deposits. Increases in consumer and wholesale loans and deposits included the impact of The Bank of New York transaction. These increases were offset partially by narrower spreads on both trading-related assets and loans, a shift to narrower-spread deposit products, RFS’s sale of the insurance business and the absence of BrownCo in AM. The Firm’s total average interest-earning assets for 2006 were $995.5 billion, up 11% from the prior year, primarily as a result of an increase in loans and other liquid earning assets, partially offset by a decline in interests in purchased receivables as a result of the restructuring and deconsolidation during the second quarter of 2006 of certain multi-seller con-duits that the Firm administered. The net yield on interest-earning assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.16%, a decrease of four basis points from the prior year. For a further discussion of Net interest income, see the Business Segment Results section on pages 34–35 of this Annual Report.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2006-03-09.@2005 represented the Firm’s first full year as a merged company; 2004 included six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. Therefore, comparisons between the two years are significantly affected by the Merger. In addition, other key factors affecting 2005 results included litigation charges to settle the Enron and Worldcom class actions, a special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, the impact of the new bankruptcy legislation on credit card charge-offs and the sale of BrownCo, as well as the global economic and market environments. In 2005, the Firm successfully completed a number of milestones in the execution of its Merger integration plan. Key accomplishments included: launching a national advertising campaign that introduced a modernized Chase brand; the conversion of 1,400 Bank One branches, 3,400 ATMs and millions of Bank One credit cards to the Chase brand; completing the operating platform conversion in Card Services; and executing a major systems conversion in Texas that united 400 Chase and Bank One branches and over 800 ATMs under common systems and branding. These accomplishments resulted in continued efficiencies from the Merger, and the Firm made significant progress toward reaching the merger-related savings target of approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. The Firm realized approximately $1.5 billion of merger savings in 2005, bringing estimated cumulative savings to $1.9 billion, and the annualized run-rate of savings entering 2006 is approximately $2.2 billion. In order to achieve these savings, the Firm expensed merger-related costs of $722 million during the year, bringing the total cumulative amount expensed since the Merger announcement to $2.1 billion. Management continues to estimate remaining Merger costs of approximately $0.9 billion to $1.4 billion, which are expected to be expensed over the next two years. The Board of Directors announced in the fourth quarter that James Dimon, President and Chief Operating Officer, would succeed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William B. Harrison, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer on December 31, 2005. Mr. Harrison remains Chairman of the Board. The Firm reported 2005 net income of $8.5 billion, or $2.38 per share, compared with net income of $4.5 billion, or $1.55 per share, for 2004. The return on common equity was 8% compared with 6% in 2004. Results included $2.0 billion in after-tax charges, or $0.57 per share, which included nonoperating litigation charges of $1.6 billion and Merger costs of $448 million. Excluding these charges, operating earnings were $10.5 billion, or $2.95 per share, and return on common equity was 10%. Operating earnings represent business results without merger-related costs, nonoperating litigation-related charges and recoveries, and costs related to conformance of accounting policies. In 2005, both the U.S. and global economies continued to expand. Gross domestic product increased by an estimated 3.0% globally with the U.S. economy growing at a slightly faster pace. The U.S. economy experienced continued rising short-term interest rates, which were driven by Federal Reserve Board actions during the course of the year. The federal funds rate increased from 2.25% to 4.25% during the year, and the yield curve flattened as long term interest rates remained broadly steady. Equity markets, both domestic and international, reflected positive performance, with the S&P 500 up 3% and international indices increasing over 20%. Capital markets activity was very strong during 2005, with debt and equity underwriting and merger and acquisition activity surpassing 2004 levels. The U.S. consumer sector showed continued strength buoyed by overall economic strength, which benefited from good levels of employment and retail sales that increased versus the prior year. This strength came despite slowing mortgage origination and refinance activity as well as significantly higher bankruptcy filings due to the new bankruptcy legislation which became effective in October 2005. The 2005 economic environment was a contributing factor to the performance of the Firm and each of its businesses. The overall economic expansion and strong level of capital markets activity helped to drive new business volume and sales growth within each business. The interest rate environment negatively affected both wholesale and consumer loan spreads, though wholesale liability spreads widened over the course of the year, benefiting Treasury & Securities Services and Commercial Banking. Additionally, the credit quality of the loan portfolio continued to remain strong, reflecting the beneficial economic environment, despite the impacts of accelerated bankruptcy filings and Hurricane Katrina. The discussion that follows highlights, on an operating basis and excluding the impact of the Merger, the performance of each of the Firm’s lines of business. Investment Bank operating earnings benefited from higher revenue and a continued benefit from the Provision for credit losses, which were offset by increased compensation expense. Revenue growth was driven by higher, although volatile, fixed income trading results, stronger equity commissions and improved investment banking fees, all of which benefited from strength in global capital markets activity. Investment banking fees had particular strength in advisory, reflecting in part the benefit of the business partnership with Cazenove, which was formed in February of 2005. As in 2004, the Provision for credit losses in 2005 was a benefit to earnings, mainly due to continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The increase in expense was primarily the result of higher performance-based incentive compensation due to increased revenues. Retail Financial Services operating earnings benefited from the overall strength of the U.S. economy, which led to increased deposit, home equity and mortgage balances. In addition to the benefit from higher balances, revenues increased due to improved mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) risk management results. Expenses declined, reflecting ongoing efficiency improvements across all businesses even as investments continued in retail banking distribution and sales, with the net addition during the year of 133 branch offices, 662 ATMs and over 1,300 personal bankers. These benefits were offset partially by narrower spreads on loans due to the interest rate environment and net losses associated with loan portfolio sale activity. The provision for credit losses benefited from improved credit trends in most consumer lending portfolios and from loan portfolio sales, but was affected negatively by a special provision related to Hurricane Katrina. Card Services operating earnings benefited from lower expenses driven by merger savings and greater efficiencies from the operating platform conversion, which resulted in lower processing and compensation costs. Revenue benefited from higher loan balances and customer charge volume resulting from marketing initiatives and increased consumer spending. Partially offsetting this growth were narrower spreads on loan balances due to an increase in accounts in their introductory rate period and higher interest rates. The managed provision for credit losses increased due to record levels of bankruptcy-related charge-offs related to the new bankruptcy legislation that became effective in October 2005 and a special provision related to Hurricane Katrina. Despite these events, underlying credit quality remained strong, with a managed net charge-off ratio of 5.21%, down from 5.27% in 2004. Commercial Banking operating earnings benefited from wider spreads and higher volumes related to liability balances and increased loan balances. Partially offsetting these benefits were narrower loan spreads related to competitive pressures in some markets and lower deposit-related fees due to higher interest rates. The provision for credit losses increased due to a special provision related to Hurricane Katrina, increased loan balances and refinements in the data used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. However, the underlying credit quality in the portfolio was strong throughout the year, as evidenced by lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans compared with 2004. Treasury & Securities Services operating earnings grew significantly in 2005. Revenue growth resulted from business growth and widening spreads on, and growth in, liability balances, all of which benefited from global economic strength and capital market activity. Partially offsetting this growth were lower deposit-related fees due to higher interest rates. Expenses decreased due to lower software impairment charges, partially offset by higher compensation expense resulting from new business growth, the Vastera acquisition completed in April, and by charges taken in the second quarter to terminate a client contract. Asset & Wealth Management operating earnings benefited from net asset inflows and asset appreciation, both the result of favorable capital markets and improved investment performance, which resulted in an increased level of Assets under management. Results also benefited from the acquisition of a majority interest in Highbridge Capital Management in the fourth quarter of 2004 and growth in deposit and loan balances. Expenses increased due primarily to the acquisition of Highbridge and higher performance-based incentive compensation related to increased revenue. Corporate segment operating earnings were affected negatively by repositioning of the Treasury Investment portfolio. This decline was offset partially by the gain on the sale of BrownCo of $1.3 billion (pre-tax) and improved Private Equity results. The Firm had, at year-end, total stockholders’ equity of $107 billion, and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%. The Firm purchased $3.4 billion, or 93.5 million shares of common stock during the year. The following forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause JPMorgan Chase’s results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2006 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global economy, financial markets and the geopolitical environment, all of which are integrally linked. While the Firm considers outcomes for, and has contingency plans to respond to, stress environments, the basic outlook for 2006 is predicated on the interest rate movements implied in the forward rate curve for U.S. treasuries, the continuation of favorable U.S. and international equity markets and continued expansion of the global economy. The performance of the Firm’s capital markets and wholesale businesses are affected by overall global economic growth and by financial market movements and activity levels. The Investment Bank enters 2006 with a strong investment banking fee pipeline and continues to focus on new product expansion initiatives, such as commodities and securitized products, which are intended to benefit growth and reduce volatility in trading results over time. Compared with 2005, the Investment Bank anticipates lower credit portfolio revenues due to reduced gains from loan workouts. Asset & Wealth Management anticipates continued growth driven by continued net inflows to Assets under supervision. Treasury & Securities Services and Commercial Banking expect growth due to increased business activity and product sales. Retail Financial Services anticipates benefiting from the expanded branch network and salesforce, and improved sales productivity and cross-selling in the branches, partially offset by pressure on loan and deposit spreads due to the higher interest rate environment. The acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services is expected to contribute modestly to earnings in 2006. Card Services anticipates that managed receivables will grow in line with the overall credit card industry, benefiting from marketing initiatives, new partnerships and the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business. Revenues and expenses also will reflect the full-year impact of the Paymentech deconsolidation and the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business. The Corporate segment includes Private Equity, Treasury and other corporate support units. The revenue outlook for the Private Equity business is directly related to the strength of the equity markets and the performance of the underlying portfolio investments. If current market conditions persist, the Firm anticipates continued realization of private equity gains in 2006, but results can be volatile from quarter to quarter. It is anticipated that Treasury net interest income will gradually improve and that the net loss in Other Corporate will be reduced as merger savings and other expense reduction initiatives, such as less excess real estate, are realized. The Provision for credit losses in 2006 is anticipated to be higher than in 2005, primarily driven by a trend toward a more normal level of provisioning for credit losses in the wholesale businesses. The consumer Provision for credit losses in 2006 should reflect generally stable underlying asset quality. However, it is anticipated that the first half of 2006 will experience lower credit card net charge-offs, as the record level of bankruptcy filings in the fourth quarter of 2005 are believed to have included bankruptcy filings that would otherwise have occurred in 2006. The second half of 2006 is expected to include increased credit card delinquencies and net charge-offs as a result of implementation of new FFIEC minimum payment rules. Firmwide expenses are anticipated to benefit as the run rate of merger savings is expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion by the end of 2006 driven by activities such as the tri-state retail conversion and data center upgrades. Offsetting the merger savings will be continued investment in distribution enhancements and new product offerings; extensive merger integration activities and upgrading of technology; and expenses related to recent acquisitions, such as the Sears Canada credit card business and Collegiate Funding Services. Total net revenue for 2005 was $54.5 billion, up 27% from 2004, primarily due to the Merger, which affected every revenue category. The increase from the prior year also was affected by a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of BrownCo; higher Trading revenue; and higher Asset management, administration and commissions, which benefited from several new investments and growth in Assets under management and assets under custody. These increases were offset partly by available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities losses as a result of repositioning of the Firm’s Treasury investment portfolio. The discussions that follow highlight factors other than the Merger that affected the 2005 versus 2004 comparison. The increase in Investment banking fees reflected continued strength in advisory, equity and debt underwriting, with particular growth in Europe, which benefited from the business partnership with Cazenove. Trading revenue increased from 2004, reflecting strength in fixed income, equities and commodities. For a further discussion of Investment banking fees and Trading revenue, which are primarily recorded in the IB, see the IB segment results on pages 36–38 of this Annual Report. The higher Lending & deposit-related fees were driven by the Merger; absent the effects of the Merger, the deposit-related fees would have been lower due to rising interest rates. In a higher interest-rate environment, the value of deposit balances to a customer is greater, resulting in a reduction of deposit-related fees. The increase in Asset management, administration and commissions revenue was driven by incremental fees from several new investments, including a majority interest in Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, the business partnership with Cazenove and the acquisition of Vastera. Also contributing to the higher level of revenue was an increase in Assets under management, reflecting net asset inflows, mainly in equity-related products, and global equity market appreciation. In addition, Assets under custody were up due to market value appreciation and new business. Commissions rose as a result of a higher volume of brokerage transactions. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for IB on pages 36–38, AWM on pages 51–52 and TSS on pages 49–50 of this Annual Report. Total net revenues, at $43.1 billion, rose by $9.7 billion, or 29%, primarily due to the Merger, which affected every category of Total net revenue. The discussion that follows highlights factors other than the Merger that affected the 2004 versus 2003 comparison. The increase in Investment banking fees was driven by significant gains in underwriting and advisory activities as a result of increased global market volumes and market share gains. Trading revenue declined by 18%, primarily due to lower portfolio management results in fixed income and equities. Lending & deposit related fees were up from 2003 due to the Merger. The rise was offset partially by lower deposit-related fees, as clients paid for services with deposits versus fees due to rising interest rates. Throughout 2004, deposit balances grew in response to rising interest rates. The increase in Asset management, administration and commissions was driven also by the full-year impact of other acquisitions – such as EFS in January 2004, Bank One’s Corporate Trust business in November 2003 and JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services in June 2003 – as well as the effect of global equity market appreciation, net asset inflows and a better product mix. In addition, a more active market for trading activities in 2004 resulted in higher brokerage commissions. Securities/private equity gains for 2004 rose from the prior year, primarily fueled by the improvement in the Firm’s private equity investment results. This change was offset by lower securities gains on the Treasury investment portfolio as a result of lower volumes of securities sold, and lower gains realized on sales due to higher interest rates. Additionally, RFS’s Home Finance business reported losses in 2004 on AFS securities, as compared with gains in 2003. Mortgage fees and related income rose as a result of higher servicing revenue; this improvement was offset partially by lower MSR risk management results and prime mortgage production revenue, and by lower gains from sales and securitizations of subprime loans as a result of management’s decision in 2004 to retain these loans. Mortgage fees and related income exclude the impact of NII and securities gains related to home mortgage activities. Credit card income increased from 2003 as a result of higher customer charge volume, which resulted in increased interchange income, and higher credit card servicing fees associated with an increase of $19.4 billion in average securitized loans. The increases were offset partially by higher volume-driven payments to partners and rewards expense. The increase in Other income from 2003 reflected gains on leveraged lease transactions, the sale of an investment in 2004 and higher net results from corporate- and bank-owned life insurance policies. These positive factors in 2004 were offset partially by gains on sales of several nonstrategic businesses and real estate properties in 2003. Net interest income rose from 2003 as growth in volumes of consumer loans and deposits, as well as wider spreads on deposits, contributed to higher net interest income. These positive factors were offset partially by lower wholesale loan balances in the IB and tighter spreads on loans, investment securities and trading assets stemming from the rise in interest rates. The Firm’s total average interest-earning assets for 2004 were $744 billion, up $154 billion from 2003. The net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.25% in 2004, an increase of four basis points from the prior year.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2005-03-02.@The Firm’s results in 2004 were affected by many factors, but the most significant of these were the Merger, the litigation charge taken in the second quarter of the year and global economic growth. The Firm reported 2004 net income of $4.5 billion, or $1.55 per share, compared with net income of $6.7 billion, or $3.24 per share, for 2003. The return on common equity was 6%, compared with 16% in 2003. Results included $3.7 billion in after-tax charges, or $1.31 per share, comprised of: Merger costs of $846 million; charges to conform accounting policies as a result of the Merger of $605 million; and a charge of $2.3 billion to increase litigation reserves. Excluding these charges, operating earnings would have been $8.2 billion, or $2.86 per share, and return on common equity would have been 11%. Operating earnings represent business results without the merger-related costs and the significant litigation charges. During the course of the year, the Firm developed a comprehensive plan of Merger integration and began to execute on the plan. Significant milestones during the year included: branding decisions for all businesses; merger of the holding companies, lead banks and credit card banks; conversion of the Bank One credit card portfolio to a new processing platform; announcement of insourcing of major technology operations; and consolidation and standardization of human resource policies and benefit plans. As part of the Merger, the Firm announced that it had targeted reducing operating expenses by $3.0 billion (pre-tax) by the end of 2007. In order to accomplish the cost reductions, the Firm announced that it expects to incur Merger costs of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion and reduce its workforce by approximately 12,000 over the same time period. In 2004, both the U.S. and global economies continued to strengthen overall, even though momentum slowed during the second half of the year due to rising oil prices. Gross domestic product increased by 3.9% globally and 4.4% in the U.S., both up from 2003. The U.S. economy experienced rising short-term interest rates, driven by Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) actions during the course of the year. The federal funds rate increased from 1.00% to 2.25% during the year and the yield curve flattened, as long-term interest rates were relatively stable. Equity markets, both domestic and international, enjoyed strong results, with the S&P 500 up 9% and international indices increasing in similar fashion. Capital markets activity during 2004 was healthy, debt underwriting was consistent with the strong levels experienced in 2003, and equity underwriting enjoyed strong and consistent activity during the year. The U.S. consumer sector showed continued strength buoyed by the overall economic strength, despite slowing mortgage origination and refinance activity. Retail sales were up over the prior year, and bankruptcy filings were down significantly from 2003. On an operating basis, net income in each of the Firm’s lines of business was affected primarily by the Merger. The discussion that follows highlights other factors which affected operating results in each business. Despite the relatively beneficial capital markets environment, results for the Investment Bank were under pressure during the year. This was primarily due to a decline in trading revenue related to lower fixed income trading, driven by weaker portfolio management results, and a reduction in net interest income, stemming primarily from lower loan balances. This was partially offset by increased investment banking fees, the result of continued strength in debt underwriting, and higher advisory fees. The Investment Bank benefited from a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, primarily due to the improved credit quality of the loan portfolio, as evidenced by the significant drop in nonperforming loans and, to a lesser extent, recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Expenses rose, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. Retail Financial Services benefited from better spreads earned on deposits and growth in retained residential mortgage and home equity loan balances. Mortgage fees and related income was also up, reflecting higher mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by significantly lower prime mortgage production income related to the slower mortgage origination activity. The Provision for credit losses benefited from improved credit quality in nearly all portfolios and a reduction in the allowance for credit losses related to the sale of a $4 billion manufactured home loan portfolio. Higher compensation expenses were due to continued expansion of the branch office network, including 130 new locations (106 net additional branches) opened during 2004 for the combined Firm, and expansion of the sales force, partially offset by ongoing efficiency improvements. Card Services revenue benefited from higher loan balances and customer charge volume, which increased net interest income and higher net interchange income, respectively. Expenses increased due to higher marketing spending and higher volume-based processing expenses. Commercial Banking revenues benefited from strong deposit growth and higher investment banking fees. These benefits were partially offset by lower service charges on deposits, which often decline when interest rates rise. Credit quality continued to improve, resulting in lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans. Treasury & Securities Services revenues benefited from strong growth in assets under custody and average deposits, along with deposit spreads, which improved due to the relatively low interest rate environment for deposits. These benefits were offset by lower service charges on deposits, which often decline when interest rates rise. Revenues and expenses also were affected by acquisitions, divestitures and growth in business volume. Expenses also increased due to software impairment charges, and legal and technology-related expenses. Asset & Wealth Management results were positively affected by the strength of global equity markets, an improved product mix, better investment performance and net asset inflows. Results also benefited from deposit and loan growth. The Corporate segment performance was negatively affected by a repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by improved Private Equity results due to an improved climate for investment sales. The Firm’s balance sheet was likewise significantly affected by the Merger. Aside from the Merger, the Firm took a number of actions during the year to strengthen the balance sheet. Notably, the Treasury investment portfolio was repositioned to reduce exposure to rising interest rates; auto leasing was de-emphasized, and lease receivables were reduced by 16% to $8 billion; the $4 billion manufactured home loan portfolio was sold; the $2 billion recreational vehicle portfolio was sold subsequent to year-end; a significant portion of third-party private equity investments have been sold; and the Firm increased its litigation reserves. The Firm’s capital base was also significantly enhanced following the Merger. As of year-end, total stockholders’ equity was $106 billion, and the Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.7%. The capital position allowed the Firm to begin repurchasing common stock during the second half of the year, with more than $700 million, or 19.3 million common shares, repurchased during the year. JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2005 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global economy, financial markets and the geopolitical environment, all of which are integrally linked together. While the Firm considers outcomes for, and has contingency plans to respond to, stress environments, its basic outlook for 2005 is predicated on the interest rate movements implied in the forward rate curve for U.S. Treasuries, the continuation of the favorable U.S. and international equity markets and continued expansion of the global economy. The performance of the Firm’s capital markets businesses is highly correlated to overall global economic growth. The Investment Bank enters 2005 with a strong pipeline for advisory and underwriting business, and it continues to focus on growing its client-driven trading business. Compared with 2004, the Investment Bank expects a reduction in credit portfolio revenues, as both net interest income on loans and gains from workouts are likely to decrease. Financial market movements and activity levels also affect Asset & Wealth Management and Treasury & Securities Services. Asset & Wealth Management anticipates revenue growth, driven by net inflows to Assets under supervision and by the Highbridge acquisition, as well as deposit and loan growth. Treasury & Securities Services anticipates modest revenue growth, due to wider spreads on deposits, as well as increased business volume and activity in the custody, trade, commercial card, American Depositary Receipt and Collateralized Debt Obligation businesses. Commercial Banking anticipates that net revenues will benefit from growth in treasury services and investment banking fees, offset by margin compression on loans. The business outlook varies for the respective consumer businesses. Card Services anticipates modest growth in consumer spending and in card outstandings. For RFS, Home Finance earnings are likely to weaken given a market-driven decline in mortgage originations, neutralizing the expected earnings increase in Consumer & Small Business Banking. The drop in revenue at Home Finance should be mitigated by ongoing efforts to bring expenses in line with lower expected origination volumes. Growth is expected to continue in Consumer & Small Business Banking, with increases in core deposits and associated revenue partially offset by ongoing investments in the branch distribution network. New branch openings should continue at a pace consistent with or slightly above those of 2004. At the heritage Chase branches, expanded hours and realigned compensation plans that tie incentives to branch performance are expected to provide improvements in productivity and incremental net revenue growth. Earnings in Auto & Education Finance are expected to remain under pressure, given the current competitive operating environment. Across all RFS businesses, credit quality trends remain stable, with a slight increase in credit costs likely in 2005. The Corporate sector includes Private Equity, Treasury and the corporate support units. The revenue outlook for the Private Equity business is directly related to the strength of equity market conditions in 2005. If current market conditions persist, the Firm anticipates continued realization of private equity gains; the Firm is not anticipating investment securities gains from the Treasury portfolio in 2005. The Provision for credit losses in 2005 is anticipated to be higher than in 2004, driven primarily by a return to a more normal level of provisioning for credit losses in the wholesale businesses over time. The consumer Provision for credit losses in 2005 should reflect increased balances, with generally stable credit quality. The Firm plans to implement higher minimum-payment requirements in the Card Services business in the third quarter of 2005; it is anticipated that this will increase delinquency and net charge-off rates, but the magnitude of the impact is currently being assessed. The Firm’s 2005 expenses should reflect the realization of $1.5 billion in merger savings. These savings are expected to be offset by a projected $1.1 billion of incremental spending related to firmwide technology infrastructure, distribution enhancement, and product improvement and expansion in Retail Financial Services, the Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, expenses will increase as a result of recent acquisitions, such as Highbridge and Cazenove. Management will seek to continue to strengthen the Firm’s balance sheet through rigorous financial and risk discipline. Any capital generated in excess of the Firm’s capital targets, and beyond that required to support anticipated modest growth in assets and the underlying risks of the Firm’s businesses, including litigation risk, will create capital flexibility in 2005 with respect to common stock repurchases and further investments in the Firm’s businesses. Total net revenues, at $43.1 billion, rose by $9.7 billion or 29%, primarily due to the Merger, which affected every category of Total net revenue. Additional factors contributing to the revenue growth were higher consumer demand for credit products and higher credit card charge volume, as well as strong retail and wholesale deposit growth. Investment banking revenues increased as a result of growth in global market volumes and market share gains. Revenue also benefited from acquisitions and growth in assets under custody, under management and under supervision, the result of global equity market appreciation and net asset inflows. Private equity gains were higher due to an improved climate for investment sales. The discussion that follows highlights factors other than the Merger that affected the 2004 versus 2003 comparison. The increase in Investment banking fees was driven by significant gains in underwriting and advisory activities as a result of increased global market volumes and market share gains. Trading revenue declined by 18%, primarily due to lower portfolio management results in fixed income and equities. For a further discussion of Investment banking fees and Trading revenue, which are primarily recorded in the IB, see the IB segment results on pages 30-32 of this Annual Report. Lending & deposit related fees were up from 2003 due to the Merger. The rise was partially offset by lower service charges on deposits, as clients paid for services with deposits, versus fees, due to rising interest rates. Throughout 2004, deposit balances grew in response to rising interest rates. The increase in Asset management, administration and commissions was also driven by the full-year impact of other acquisitions - such as EFS in January 2004, Bank One’s Corporate Trust business in November 2003 and JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services in June 2003 - as well as the effect of global equity market appreciation, net asset inflows and a better product mix. In addition, a more active market for trading activities in 2004 resulted in higher brokerage commissions. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for AWM on pages 45-46, TSS on pages 43-44 and RFS on pages 33-38 of this Annual Report. Securities/private equity gains for 2004 rose from the prior year, primarily fueled by the improvement in the Firm’s private equity investment results. This was offset by lower securities gains on the Treasury investment portfolio as a result of lower volumes of securities sold, and lower gains realized on sales due to higher interest rates; additionally, RFS’s Home Finance business reported losses in 2004 on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, as compared with gains in 2003. For a further discussion of securities gains, see the RFS and Corporate segment discussions on pages 33-38 and 47-48, respectively, of this Annual Report. For a further discussion of Private equity gains, which are primarily recorded in the Firm’s Private Equity business, see the Corporate segment discussion on pages 47-48 of this Annual Report. Mortgage fees and related income rose as a result of higher servicing revenue; this improvement was partially offset by lower mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset risk management results and prime mortgage production revenue, and lower gains from sales and securitizations of subprime loans as a result of management’s decision in 2004 to retain these loans. Mortgage fees and related income excludes the impact of NII and securities gains related to home mortgage activities. For a discussion of Mortgage fees and related income, which is primarily recorded in RFS’s Home Finance business, see the Home Finance discussion on pages 34-36 of this Annual Report. Credit card income increased from 2003 as a result of higher customer charge volume, which resulted in increased interchange income, and higher credit card servicing fees associated with the increase of $19.4 billion in average securitized loans. The increases were partially offset by higher volume-driven payments to partners and rewards expense. For a further discussion of Credit card income, see CS’s segment results on pages 39-40 of this Annual Report. The increase in Other income from 2003 reflected gains on leveraged lease transactions and higher net results from corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies. These positive factors in 2004 were partially offset by gains on sales of several nonstrategic businesses and real estate properties in 2003. Net interest income rose from 2003 as growth in volumes of consumer loans and deposits, as well as wider spreads on deposits, contributed to higher net interest income. These were partially offset by lower wholesale loan balances in the IB and tighter spreads on loans, investment securities and trading assets stemming from the rise in interest rates. The Firm’s total average interest-earning assets for 2004 were $744.1 billion, up $154.2 billion from 2003. Growth was also driven by higher levels of consumer loans. The net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.27% in 2004, an increase of 6 basis points from the prior year.
.@0000019617.@JPM.@2004-02-18.@In 2003, global growth strengthened relative to the prior two years. The U.S. economy improved significantly, supported by diminishing geopolitical uncertainties, new tax relief, strong profit growth, low interest rates and a rising stock market. Productivity at U.S. businesses continued to grow at an extraordinary pace, as a result of ongoing investment in information technologies. Profit margins rose to levels not seen in a long time. New hiring remained tepid, but signs of an improving job market emerged late in the year. Inflation fell to the lowest level in more than 40 years, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) declared that its long-run goal of price stability had been achieved. Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) reported 2003 Net income of $6.7 billion, compared with Net income of $1.7 billion in 2002. All five of the Firm’s lines of business benefited from the improved economic conditions, with each reporting increased revenue over 2002. In particular, the low–interest rate environment drove robust fixed income markets and an unprecedented mortgage refinancing boom, resulting in record earnings in the Investment Bank and Chase Financial Services. Total revenue for 2003 was $33.3 billion, up 12% from 2002. The Investment Bank’s revenue increased by approximately $1.9 billion from 2002, and Chase Financial Services’ revenue was $14.6 billion in 2003, another record year. Total Noninterest expense was $21.7 billion, down 5% from the prior year. In 2002, the Firm recorded $1.3 billion of charges, principally for Enron-related surety litigation and the establishment of litigation reserves; and $1.2 billion for Merger and restructuring costs related to programs announced prior to January 1, 2002. Excluding these costs, expenses rose by 7% in 2003, reflecting higher performance-related incentives; increased costs related to stock-based compensation and pension and other postretirement expenses; and higher occupancy expenses. The Firm began expensing stock options in 2003. Restructuring costs associated with initiatives announced after January 1, 2002, were recorded in their relevant expense categories and totaled $630 million in 2003, down 29% from 2002. The 2003 Provision for credit losses of $1.5 billion was down $2.8 billion, or 64%, from 2002. The provision was lower than total net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, reflecting significant improvement in the quality of the commercial loan portfolio. Commercial nonperforming assets and criticized exposure levels declined 42% and 47%, respectively, from December 31, 2002. Consumer credit quality remained stable. Earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) for the year were $3.24, an increase of 305% over the EPS of $0.80 reported in 2002. Results in 2002 were provided on both a reported basis and an operating basis, which excluded Merger and restructuring costs and special items. Operating EPS in 2002 was $1.66. See page 28 of this Annual Report for a reconciliation between reported and operating EPS. The Firm’s wholesale businesses are known globally as “JPMorgan,” and its national consumer and middle market businesses are known as “Chase.” The wholesale businesses comprise four segments: the Investment Bank (“IB”), Treasury & Securities Services (“TSS”), Investment Management & Private Banking (“IMPB”) and JPMorgan Partners (“JPMP”). IB provides a full range of investment banking and commercial banking products and services, including advising on corporate strategy and structure, capital raising, risk management, and market-making in cash securities and derivative instruments in all major capital markets. The three businesses within TSS provide debt servicing, securities custody and related functions, and treasury and cash management services to corporations, financial institutions and governments. The IMPB business provides investment management services to institutional investors, high net worth individuals and retail customers and also provides personalized advice and solutions to wealthy individuals and families. JPMP, the Firm’s private equity business, provides equity and mezzanine capital financing to private companies. The Firm’s national consumer and middle market businesses, which provide lending and full-service banking to consumers and small and middle market businesses, comprise Chase Financial Services (“CFS”). Global economic conditions and financial markets activity are expected to continue to improve in 2004. While rising interest rates may negatively affect the mortgage and Global Treasury businesses; on the positive side, gains in market share, rising equity values and increased market activity may benefit many of the Firm’s other businesses. The Firm expects to see a different mix of earnings in 2004. IB is targeting higher issuer and investor client revenue, but securities gains and net interest income may be lower. Mortgage earnings are likely to decline from the record set in 2003, and growth in other retail businesses may not be sufficient to offset the decline in mortgage revenue. Improved equity markets and increased M&A activity may provide increased exit opportunities in private equity and could result in higher fees in IMPB and in the custody business of TSS. Commercial net charge-off ratios may be lower, but credit costs may rise as the reduction in the Allowance for credit losses slows. The Firm expects stable consumer net charge-off ratios in 2004.
 .@0000072333.@JWN.@2019-03-18.@Nordstrom is a leading fashion retailer offering an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men, young adults and children. We serve customers through two businesses — Full-Price and Off-Price. With customers increasingly engaging with Nordstrom in multiple ways, we focus on providing a seamless experience across stores and online. Our operations currently consist of our Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, U.S. and Canada Nordstrom Rack stores, Jeffrey boutiques, Last Chance clearance stores, Trunk Club clubhouses and Nordstrom Local. Additionally, customers are served online through Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com, HauteLook and TrunkClub.com. Our unique business model is a key point of difference in serving customers in multiple ways — through stores, online, Full-Price and Off-Price — with meaningful synergies across Nordstrom. We are focused on leveraging our digital and physical assets to provide customers with a best-in-class experience. In 2018, net earnings were $564, or $3.32 per diluted share, which included a $0.05 favorable income tax benefit related to prior periods and an estimated non-recurring credit-related charge of $0.28 (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Our net sales grew 2.3%, or approximately 3.8% excluding approximately $220 related to the 53rd week in 2017. We maintained a strong financial position, generating annual operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the 10th consecutive year and returning nearly $1 billion to shareholders in 2018. In 2018, we achieved the following milestones in executing our customer strategy through our three strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand: We continue to see positive customer trends. We had over 35 million customers, an increase of 6% from last year. One-third of our customers shopped across our multiple channels, resulting in incremental customer spend. Our early investments to build a robust digital business gives us a competitive advantage. Digital sales increased 16% and made up 30% of net sales. Additionally, Nordstrom.com has achieved scale, with the profitability of Full-Price digital sales at parity with store sales. Generational investments continued to scale, contributing approximately $2 billion in sales and improvement in profitability. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook became our fastest business to reach $1 billion in sales. Trunk Club delivered sales growth of 35%. We opened our Men’s Store in New York City and furthered our expansion into Canada with the introduction of six Nordstrom Rack stores. In 2019, we have two key priorities to drive sales and market share gains. The first key priority is our local market strategy, which launched in 2018 and drove outsized market share gains in Los Angeles. We are focused on scaling in this top market by giving customers greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. In addition, we are implementing aspects of our local market strategy in other markets. We will further leverage inventory through our supply chain investments. This includes an Omni-channel Hub in the Los Angeles area to accelerate inventory efficiencies, as well as a one-million square foot Omni-channel center in Riverside, California that will enable faster delivery to the West Coast, which represents 40% of our customer base, at a lower cost to us. While we’re launching this local market strategy in Los Angeles first, we anticipate expanding it to our top markets in the future. We expect to expand our presence in New York City with the planned opening of our Nordstrom NYC women’s store in October. We expect that our NYC flagship, coupled with our digital presence, will contribute a meaningful sales lift in that market. Our second key priority to drive sales and market share gains is our loyalty program. In 2018, our loyalty customers grew 16% to 11 million and contributed 56% of our sales. In October 2018, we launched our enhanced program, The Nordy Club. Cardmembers now earn three points for every dollar spent, up from two points. In addition, we added experiential elements, such as exclusive access to services and experiences. Going forward, we plan to pursue additional opportunities to further personalize the customer experience and drive increased spend. We remain focused on driving higher shareholder returns through three key deliverables: growing market share, improving profitability and shareholder returns and continuing our disciplined capital allocation approach. We are well-positioned to execute against our long-term plans and deliver a differentiated customer experience. In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing customers with a seamless experience across our channels. We invested early in our omni-channel capabilities, integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online, in both our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses. While our customers may engage with us through multiple channels, we know they value the overall Nordstrom brand experience and view us simply as Nordstrom, which is ultimately how we view our business. We have one reportable segment in 2018, Retail, and analyze our results on a total Company basis. Similar to other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017 (the “53rd week”). References to 2018 and all years except 2017 within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, while 2017 is based on a 53-week fiscal year. However, the 53rd week is not included in the comparable sales calculations. We may not calculate certain metrics used to evaluate our business in a consistent manner among industry peers. Provided below are definitions of metrics we present within our analysis: Comparable Sales – sales from stores that have been open at least one full year at the beginning of the year. In 2019, we expect net sales growth to approximate comparable sales. As a result, we will only report net sales growth Comparable sales include digital sales and actual returns. Our estimate for sales return allowance is not included in the comparable sales calculations. Due to the 53rd week in 2017, our 2018 comparable sales are reported on a like-for-like basis with no impact from calendar shifts or the new Revenue Standard (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Digital Sales – online sales and digitally assisted store sales which include Buy Online, Pick Up in Store (“BOPUS”), Ship to Store, Reserve Online, Try in Store (Store Reserve) and Style Board, a digital selling tool Gross Profit – net sales less cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs nventory Turnover Rate – trailing 4-quarter cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs divided by the trailing 4-quarter average inventory. During the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective adoption method (see Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8). Results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 are presented under the new Revenue Standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted. Also beginning in 2018, we aligned our sales presentation with how we view the results of our operations internally and how our customers shop with us, by our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses. In 2018, we allocated our sales return allowance and loyalty related adjustments to Full-Price and Off-Price. For 2017 and 2016, Other primarily included unallocated sales return, in-transit and loyalty related adjustments necessary to reconcile sales by business to total net sales. n 2018, total Company net sales increased 2.3%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 150 basis points due to the 53rd week, which contributed approximately $220 in additional net sales in 2017. Digital sales increased 16% compared with 2017. During the year, we opened our Nordstrom Men’s Store NYC, six Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada and six in the U.S., one Jeffrey boutique and two Nordstrom Locals. We closed two full-line stores and one Trunk Club clubhouse. Full-Price net sales decreased 1.5%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 300 basis points primarily due to loyalty related adjustments and the 53rd week. Full-Price sales reflected an increase in the average selling price per item sold, partially offset by a decrease in the number of items sold. Kids’ was the top-performing merchandise category. Off-Price net sales increased 4.5%, compared with 2017. This included a decrease of approximately 250 basis points primarily due to the 53rd week and loyalty related adjustments. Off-Price sales reflected an increase in the number of items sold, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per item sold. The top-performing merchandise category was Shoes. In 2017, total Company net sales increased 4.4%, compared with 2016. Digital sales increased 16% compared with 2016. During the year, we opened two full-line stores, including one in Canada, and 17 Nordstrom Rack stores. The 53rd week contributed approximately $220 in additional net sales. Full-Price net sales increased 1.9% compared with 2016. Full-Price sales reflected an increase in the average selling price per item sold and an increase in the number of items sold. Kids’ was the top-performing merchandise category. Off-Price net sales increased 9.9% compared with 2016. Off-Price sales reflected an increase in the number of items sold, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price per item sold. Beauty was the top-performing merchandise category.

Our customers can participate in our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program which allows them to earn merchandise, services and other experiences. We also offer our customers a variety of payment products and services, including our Nordstrom co-branded credit cards. As we aspire to be the best fashion retailer, our customer strategy is centered on three strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering, delivering exceptional services and experiences, and leveraging the strength of our brand. In 2017, net earnings were $437, or $2.59 per diluted share, which included impacts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), consisting of a $0.25 per share reduction related to our income tax provision and a $0.06 per share decrease for a one-time investment in our employees. We reached record sales of $15 billion in 2017. Our net sales increased 4.4%, inclusive of approximately $220 or 150 basis points from the impact of the 53rd week, while comparable sales increased 0.8% and are not inclusive of the 53rd week. We achieved the following milestones in executing our growth plans. Nordstrom experienced continued positive customer trends, reflecting customer growth of 4% to 33 million customers. Additionally, 9 million customers are shopping with us in multiple ways, a 6% increase over the previous year. Generational investments, which include Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club, contributed $1.5 billion in sales. In the Nordstrom full-price business, strategic brands, including product with limited distribution and Nordstrom proprietary labels, continued to deliver outsized sales growth. The Nordstrom Rack off-price business gained 6 million new customers with approximately one-third of off-price customers expected to cross-shop the full-price business over time. Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program customers increased by 35% to 10.5 million. Sales from Nordstrom Rewards customers represented 51% of sales, an increase from 44% in 2016. Looking ahead to 2018, we are executing on our three strategic pillars through a series of initiatives. On April 12, our Nordstrom Men’s Store NYC is slated to open, with our Nordstrom NYC store opening in Fall 2019. We expect this store to be the biggest and best statement of the Nordstrom brand, serving as a gateway to new customers both domestically and internationally. We are also focusing on further integrating our digital and physical assets in our top markets in order to deliver best-in-class services and experiences to customers in those areas. We will bring our capabilities across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to create a digitally-connected and differentiated experience for customers to shop on their terms, starting in Los Angeles, our largest market. We believe that we will gain learnings from our experiences in the Los Angeles market that we can apply to other markets in the future. Another key initiative for 2018 is the introduction of six Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada, where we completed our full-line store expansion plans last September. Similar to our experience in the U.S., we expect strong synergies between our full-price and off-price businesses. Finally, we will continue to curate our assortment to provide newness and the opportunity for discovery for our customers. In our full-price business, our focus is on strategic brand growth through new launches and our existing partners. In our off-price business, leveraging our vendor partnerships enables us to offer the best brands at the best prices. Our strategic brand partnerships and combined digital and physical assets make us uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We believe our diversified and resilient business model will continue to serve us well while creating value for our shareholders, customers and employees. Our reportable segments in 2017 are Retail and Credit. We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and Credit, while interest expense, income taxes and earnings per share are discussed on a total Company basis. Similar to many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2017 (the “53rd week”). References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. References to 2016 and 2015 are based on a 52-week fiscal year.

As of January 28, 2017, our stores are located in 40 states throughout the United States and in three provinces in Canada. Our customers can participate in our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program which allows them to earn points based on their level of spending. We also offer our customers a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. Our 2016 earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $1.12, exceeded our outlook of $1.70 to $1.80. Our results were driven by continued operational efficiencies in inventory and expense execution and demonstrated our team’s speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions. We reached record sales of $14.5 billion for the year, reflecting a net sales increase of 2.9% and comparable sales decrease of 0.4% primarily driven by full-line stores. We achieved the following milestones in multiple growth areas: Our expansion into Canada where we currently have five full-line stores, including two that opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 in 2016. Nordstrom.com sales reached over $2.5 billion, representing approximately 25% of full-price sales. Our off-price business reached $4.5 billion, with growth mainly driven by our online net sales increase of 32% and 21 new store openings. Off-price continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining approximately 6 million in 2016. Our expanded Nordstrom Rewards program, which launched in the second quarter, drove a strong customer response with 3.7 million customers joining through our non-tender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers. Our working capital improvements contributed to the $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $0.6 billion in free cash flow. From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be strategic and pursue partnerships that are similar to our portfolio and maintain relevance with our customers by delivering newness. Our strategies around product differentiation include our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands such as Ivy Park, J.Crew and Good American, in addition to our Nordstrom exclusive offering. In 2016, we made focused efforts to improve our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain and marketing. In technology, we increased the productivity of delivering features to enhance the customer experience. In supply chain, we focused on overall profitability by reducing split shipments and editing out less profitable items online. In marketing, we strengthened our capabilities around digital engagement so that we reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Through these efforts, we made significant progress in improving operational efficiencies, reflected by moderated expense growth of 10% in these three key areas, relative to an annual average of 20% over the past five years. With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it is important that we remain focused on the customer. Moving forward, we believe our strategies give us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share.

These increases reflected continued momentum in our Nordstrom.com channel, which increased 15%. Also on a comparable basis, the total number of items sold and the average selling price per item sold increased. The top-performing merchandise categories included Beauty and Women’s Apparel. The Northwest was the top-performing U.S. full-line store geographic region. Off-price net sales increased 13.7%, compared with 2014, while on a comparable basis, sales increased 4.3%. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of 47%. Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 9.9%, attributable to new store openings. On a comparable basis, the average retail price per item sold increased at Nordstrom Rack, offset by a decrease in the total number of items sold. Shoes and Beauty were the top-performing merchandise categories and the South was the top-performing geographic region. Our Retail GP rate was relatively flat compared with 2015, reflecting higher occupancy costs associated with Nordstrom Rack and Canada store growth, in addition to increased markdowns in the first half of the year to realign inventory to sales trends. This was offset by strong inventory execution during the remainder of the year and reduced competitive markdowns. Our ending inventory per square foot decrease of 6.4% in 2016 reflected this strong inventory execution. Our Retail GP rate decreased 92 basis points compared with 2014 primarily due to higher cost of sales driven by increased markdowns from lower than planned sales and in response to an elevated promotional environment during the second half of the year. Retail GP increased $225 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to an increase in net sales, partially offset by increased markdowns. Our inventory turnover rate decreased to 4.54 in 2015 due to softer sales trends experienced during the second half of the year. Our ending inventory per square foot increased 6.1% in 2015, which outpaced our sales per square foot increase of 2.9%. The growth of our online channels contributed to increases in inventory without corresponding increases in square footage.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2016-03-14.@Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men, young adults and children. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise through our various channels, including Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Trunk Club clubhouses and TrunkClub.com, our Jeffrey boutiques and our Last Chance clearance store. As of January 30, 2016, our stores are located in 39 states throughout the United States and in three provinces in Canada. In addition, we offer our customers a Nordstrom Rewards™ loyalty program along with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. In 2015, we continued to grow our business despite a more challenging retail environment in the second half of the year. We added nearly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total net sales growth of 7.5% and a comparable sales increase of 2.7%. During the year, we achieved the following milestones in executing our customer strategy: opened our first international flagship store in Vancouver, British Columbia, the most successful opening in our Company history grew Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook by 47%, reaching over $500 in sales expanded our fulfillment network with our third fulfillment center in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, located within two-day delivery of approximately half the U.S. population returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, of which $1.8 billion resulted from the sale of our credit card receivables From a merchandising perspective, we’re constantly pursuing newness and fashion to increase our relevance with customers. Brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury have contributed to the strength of our younger customer-focused departments and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we saw continued momentum in Beauty, which has been among our top-performing categories for the fourth straight year. On October 1st, we completed the sale of our credit card portfolio to TD. Our mutual commitment to having Nordstrom employees serve our customers directly was paramount to this partnership. We are able to retain all aspects of customer-facing activities, aligning with our strategy of enhancing the customer experience while allowing for improvement in capital efficiency. In addition, we consider our loyalty program as an enabler of growth to increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With sales to Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer in 2016. Over the past several years, we’ve made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets. Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club added over $400 to our top-line growth in 2015, while Nordstrom Rack’s expansion of 27 new stores contributed nearly $230 to our top-line growth. These investments have resulted in market share gains, but also represent an evolution of our business resulting in expenses growing faster than sales in recent years. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to view 2015 as our peak investment year. While we have successfully increased market share, we are also committed to increasing efficiency, lowering costs while increasing effectiveness and gaining profitability. With our investments moderating, we expect 2016 to represent an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. As our business evolves, our focus continues to be guided by customer expectations around speed, convenience and personalization. We believe that we are well positioned with the right strategies in place to successfully serve our customers, which will in turn lead to long-term profitable growth and top-quartile total shareholder return. Our reportable segments are Retail and Credit. We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and Credit, while interest expense, income taxes, earnings per share and return on invested capital are discussed on a total Company basis. Our Retail Business includes our Nordstrom-branded U.S. and Canada full-line stores and Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook, Trunk Club, Jeffrey and our Last Chance clearance store. For purposes of discussion and analysis of our results of operations of our Retail Business, we combine our Retail segment results with revenues and expenses in the “Corporate/Other” column of Note 17: Segment Reporting in Item 8 (collectively, the “Retail Business”). Certain metrics we use to evaluate the Retail Business may not be calculated in a consistent manner among industry peers. Provided below are definitions of metrics we present within our analysis of the Retail Business: Comparable Sales – sales from stores that have been open at least one full year at the beginning of the year. Total Company comparable sales include sales from our online channels (Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) because of the integration with our stores. Gross Profit – net sales less cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs. Inventory Turnover Rate – annual cost of sales and related buying and occupancy costs (for all segments) divided by the trailing 4-quarter average inventory. Total Sales Per Square Foot – net sales divided by weighted-average square footage. 4-wall Sales Per Square Foot – sales for Nordstrom U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom Rack stores, Trunk Club clubhouses, Jeffrey boutiques and our Last Chance store divided by their weighted-average square footage. In 2015, total Company net sales increased 7.5%, while comparable sales increased 2.7%. During the year, we opened five Nordstrom full-line stores, including two in Canada, and 27 Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions increased our square footage by 6.4% and represented 2.8% of our total net sales for 2015. Our full-price net sales, which consist of the U.S. full-line and Nordstrom.com channels, increased 2.6% compared with 2014, with comparable sales up 2.3%. These increases reflected continued momentum in our Nordstrom.com channel, which increased 15%, while U.S. full-line store net sales decreased 0.6% in 2015 compared with 2014. On a comparable basis, we experienced an increased volume of transactions partially offset by a decrease in the average number of items sold per transaction. Category leaders included Beauty and Women’s Apparel. U.S. full-line store comparable sales decreased by 1.1%. The Northwest and Southwest were the top-performing full-line geographic regions. Within our off-price offering, Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 9.9%, compared with 2014, reflecting the accelerated expansion of new stores. Comparable sales decreased 1.0% for the year. Shoes and Cosmetics were the top-performing categories, while the South was the top-performing geographic region. Nordstrom Rack experienced an increase in the average retail price per item sold offset by a decrease in the total number of items sold. Sales per square foot of Nordstrom Rack decreased due to store expansion. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of 47%. Total Company net sales for 2014 increased 7.8% compared with 2013, which was attributable to a comparable sales increase of 4.0%. During 2014, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, including our first store in Canada, 27 Nordstrom Rack stores and acquired Trunk Club. These additions represented 2.8% of our total net sales for 2014 and increased our square footage by 5.5%. Full-price net sales for 2014 increased 3.8% compared with 2013, with comparable sales up 3.6%. These increases were largely due to the performance of our Nordstrom.com channel. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased on a comparable basis in 2014 compared with 2013. Category leaders included Accessories, Cosmetics and Men’s Apparel. U.S. full-line store net sales for 2014 decreased 0.3% compared with 2013, which was primarily driven by a decrease in comparable sales. The top-performing geographic regions for 2014 were the Southeast and Southwest. Our Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook channels experienced outsized growth, with a net sales increase of 23% at Nordstrom.com and 22% at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook compared with 2013. These increases were driven by both expanded merchandise selection and ongoing technology investments to enhance the customer experience. Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 17% compared with 2013, reflecting incremental volume from existing stores and the impact of new store openings. On a comparable basis, the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise increased while the number of items sold was flat. Shoes and Accessories were the strongest-performing categories for 2014. The table below provides a detailed view of the operational results of our Credit segment, consistent with Note 17: Segment Reporting in Item 8. In order to better reflect the economic contribution of our credit and debit card program, intercompany merchant fees are also included in the table below, which represent the estimated costs that would be incurred if cardholders used non-Nordstrom-branded cards instead of our cards in store and online. Prior to October 1, 2015, interest expense at the Credit segment was equal to the amount of interest related to securitized debt plus an amount assigned to the Credit segment in proportion to the estimated debt and equity needed to fund our credit card receivables. Based on our research, debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from 70% to 90%. As such, we considered a mix of 80% debt and 20% equity to be appropriate, and therefore assigned interest expense to the Credit segment as if it carried debt of up to 80% of the credit card receivables. Subsequent to the sale, we no longer allocate interest expense to the Credit segment as we do not fund the accounts receivable now owned by TD.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2015-03-16.@Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise through our various channels: “Nordstrom” branded full-line stores and online store at Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook and other retail channels, including Trunk Club showrooms and TrunkClub.com, our Jeffrey boutiques and our clearance store that operates under the name “Last Chance.” As of January 31, 2015, our stores are located in 38 states throughout the United States and in one province in Canada. In addition, we offer our customers a Nordstrom Rewards™ loyalty program along with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. We continue to see the ongoing evolution of retail, with increasing customer interaction between our stores and ecommerce. We are making progress to meet customer expectations of a personalized experience that merges the richness of stores with the convenience of online. Because the customer views us simply as Nordstrom, we believe there is tremendous value in strengthening our platform for the customer experience that encompasses full-price, off-price, in-store and online. While each channel represents a substantial growth opportunity, there are significant synergies across channels to create a unique customer experience to gain market share. We considered 2014 a watershed year in our company history, with our successful entry into Canada, continued expansion of our Nordstrom Rack business through store growth, the launch of Nordstromrack.com and the acquisition of Trunk Club. Our performance in 2014 reflected continued progress in executing our customer strategy through investments to drive growth across channels. We achieved total net sales growth of 7.8%, adding nearly $1 billion to our top-line and delivering record sales and earnings per diluted share. Our financial position remains strong and this marked the sixth consecutive year we generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operations. Our partnership with vendors and brands enhances our product offering. We offer Topshop merchandise at 53 full-line stores and online, with plans to reach over 80 stores in 2015. Our new partnership with Madewell in 2015, initially available at 15 of our stores and online, is another way to provide sought-after brands that appeal to new and existing customers. In 2014, we opened our first full-line store in Canada in Calgary, Alberta, reflecting a multi-year effort from our team to address the unique challenges of crossing the border. With our store outperforming our expectations, we are encouraged with our customers’ response in this market. We are looking forward to opening stores in 2015 in Ottawa, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia. In the U.S. we increased our presence with two full-line stores in The Woodlands, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida. In 2015, we plan to open three full-line stores in Puerto Rico, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At Nordstrom Rack, we offer customers great brands at great prices, with 48 of the top 50 full-line brands represented. We opened 27 Nordstrom Rack stores in 2014, a record number of openings, contributing to Nordstrom Rack’s total sales growth of 17%. Our online businesses continue to be our fastest-growing channels. In the spring of 2014, we expanded our capabilities through the launch of Nordstromrack.com, providing a seamless integration with HauteLook. We more than doubled our merchandise selection, which accelerated growth in this channel in the second half of 2014. Demonstrating synergies across our businesses, we enabled customers to return purchases from HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com to any of our Nordstrom Rack stores, which drove nearly one million incremental trips to Nordstrom Rack stores. Nordstrom.com finished its fifth consecutive year of approximately 20% or more comparable sales growth, with a key driver being increased merchandise selection. In 2015, we plan to open our third fulfillment center, located in Pennsylvania, which will enhance the customer experience through faster delivery. Furthermore, we have extended our full-price offering with our acquisition of Trunk Club, a high-growth business offering a new approach to personalized service. Our credit business, through our Nordstrom Rewards program, continues to play an important role in attracting new customers and deepening our engagement with existing customers. The program contributes to our overall results, with members shopping more frequently and spending more on average than non-members. For the third consecutive year, we opened over one million new accounts. With over four million active members, 2014 sales from members represented approximately 40% of our sales. We are confident in our ability to execute our customer strategy as we evolve with customers and continue to leverage capabilities across all channels to serve customers on their terms. To enhance the customer experience, we continue to make investments in our stores in new markets such as Canada, Puerto Rico and Manhattan, in our ecommerce and fulfillment capabilities and in technology to support growth across all channels. We believe these investments in our customer strategy will help us achieve long-term top-quartile shareholder returns through high single-digit total sales growth and mid-teens Return on Invested Capital. Our reportable segments are Retail and Credit. Our Retail segment includes our U.S. Nordstrom branded full-line stores and online store, Nordstrom Rack stores, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook and other retail channels, including Trunk Club, Jeffrey, our Canada store and our Last Chance clearance store. For purposes of discussion and analysis of our results of operations of our Retail Business, we combine our Retail segment results with revenues and expenses in the “Corporate/Other” column of Note 16: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and Credit, while interest expense and income taxes are discussed on a total company basis. Similar to many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2012 (the “53rd week”). The analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources compares the 52 weeks in 2013 to the 53 weeks in 2012. However, the 53rd week is not included in comparable sales calculations. In 2012, the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.04 to earnings per diluted share. In 2014, total company net sales increased 7.8%, which was attributable to the comparable sales increase of 4.0%. During the year, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, including our first store in Canada, and 27 Nordstrom Rack stores. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Trunk Club, we acquired four Trunk Club showrooms and opened one additional Trunk Club showroom in 2014. These additions increased our square footage by 5.5% and represented 2.8% of our total net sales for 2014. Nordstrom net sales, which consist of the U.S. full-line and Nordstrom.com businesses, were $9,678 in 2014, an increase of 3.8% compared with 2013, with comparable sales up 3.6%. These increases reflected continued momentum in our Nordstrom.com channel. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased on a comparable basis in 2014. Category highlights included Accessories, Cosmetics and Men’s Apparel. U.S. full-line net sales for 2014 were $7,682, a decrease of 0.3% compared with 2013 and comparable sales decreased by 0.5%. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores were the Southeast and Southwest. Our Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook channels continued to experience outsized growth. Nordstrom.com net sales increased 23% and Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook net sales increased 22%, both driven by expanded merchandise selection and ongoing technology investments to enhance the customer experience. Nordstrom Rack net sales increased $477, or 17%, compared with 2013, reflecting incremental volume from existing stores and the impact of 27 new stores since fiscal 2013. Comparable sales increased 3.8% for the year. Shoes and Accessories were the top-performing categories for the year. On a comparable basis, the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise increased while the number of items sold was flat. Net sales for 2013 increased 3.4% compared with 2012, driven by a comparable sales increase of 2.5%, attributable to growth at Nordstrom.com and Nordstrom Rack’s accelerated store expansion. During 2013, we opened 22 Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated one Nordstrom full-line store and two Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions represented 1.6% of our total net sales for 2013 and increased our square footage by 2.9%. The 53rd week in 2012 contributed approximately $162 in additional net sales. Nordstrom net sales for 2013 were $9,327, an increase of 1.0% compared with 2012, with comparable sales up 2.3%. Strong growth at Nordstrom.com was partially offset by sales decreases at our full-line stores. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased on a comparable basis in 2013 compared with 2012. Category highlights included Cosmetics, Men’s Shoes and Women’s Apparel. Full-line net sales for 2013 were $7,705, a decrease of 3.3% compared with 2012, which was primarily driven by a comparable sales decrease of 2.1% for the year. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores for 2013 were the Southwest and Southeast. Nordstrom.com showed strong sales growth with net sales of $1,622, an increase of 28% compared with 2012, with comparable sales up 30% on a comparable 52-week basis. These increases were driven by expanded merchandise selection and ongoing technology investments to enhance the customer experience. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,738, up 12.0% compared with 2012, primarily due to 37 new store openings in 2012 and 2013. Comparable sales increased 2.7% for the year. Cosmetics and Shoes were the strongest-performing categories for the year. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased on a comparable basis in 2013 compared with 2012. he table below provides a detailed view of the operational results of our Credit segment, consistent with Note 16: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In order to better reflect the economic contribution of our credit and debit card program, intercompany merchant fees are also included in the table below, which represent the estimated costs that would be incurred if our cardholders used third-party cards instead of ours. Interest expense at the Credit segment is equal to the amount of interest related to securitized debt plus an amount assigned to the Credit segment in proportion to the estimated debt and equity needed to fund our credit card receivables. Based on our research, debt as a percentage of credit card receivables for other credit card companies ranges from 70% to 90%. As such, we believe a mix of 80% debt and 20% equity is appropriate, and therefore assign interest expense to the Credit segment as if it carried debt of up to 80% of the credit card receivables. Our average credit card receivable investment metric below represents the remaining 20% to fund our credit card receivables.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2014-03-17.@Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise through our various channels: “Nordstrom” branded full-line stores and online store at Nordstrom.com, “Nordstrom Rack” off-price stores, “Last Chance” clearance store, “HauteLook” online private sale website and our “Jeffrey” boutiques. Our stores are located in 35 states throughout the United States. In addition, we offer our customers a loyalty program along with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. We achieved several milestones in 2013 with a record high in sales, earnings per diluted share, and cash flow from operations. This marked the fifth consecutive year we generated over one billion dollars in cash flow from operations. Additionally, we generated a Return on Invested Capital of 13.6% while increasing our capital investments by over 50%. Our performance in 2013 reflected our continued progress in executing our customer strategy through investments to drive growth across channels, while maintaining our operating discipline around inventory and expenses. With advancements in technology and specifically in e-commerce, the pace of change is accelerating and redefining the customer experience across all channels. We believe there is tremendous value in having a platform for the customer experience that encompasses full-price and off-price, in-store and online. While each of these channels represents a substantial individual opportunity, there is significant potential for synergies between them to create a unique customer experience across channels to gain market share. Our Direct business continues to be our fastest-growing customer channel. Direct finished its third consecutive year of approximately 30% or more of same-store sales growth, with a key driver being increased merchandise selection. We also increased our speed of fulfillment and delivery, opened a fulfillment center in San Bernardino and announced plans to open an east coast fulfillment center in 2015 to enable greater customer service. We are on track to serve more customers through Nordstrom Rack’s accelerated store expansion, with plans to reach approximately 230 stores by 2016, from 140 stores today. Nordstrom Rack net sales increased 12%, driven by 22 new stores, and same-store sales increased 2.7%. Nordstrom Rack sales productivity remains strong at approximately $550 per square foot. Additionally, Rack stores can now accept HauteLook merchandise returns, adding convenience for our customers while driving incremental traffic to our Racks and further integrating the customer experience across channels. While Nordstrom full-line sales trends were softer than anticipated, we have ongoing initiatives around product, service, and the store environment to elevate the customer experience. Our relocated Glendale, California store incorporated new design concepts that reflect our customers’ desire for stores that are easier to shop, and we plan to incorporate new designs in future renovations and store openings to continue meeting our customers changing expectations. We also enhanced our relevance with existing and new customers, demonstrated in part by our Women’s Apparel business, which was one of our top-performing merchandise categories for the year. We have attracted newer and younger customers with our repositioned Savvy department to offer on-trend fashion at accessible price points and our expanded partnership with Topshop, an internationally renowned trend-leading brand. We expanded Topshop merchandise to 41 full-line stores this year, from 14 at the start of the year. Our credit business also plays an important role in reaching new customers and strengthening existing customer relationships through our Nordstrom Rewards™ program, payment products and our ability to serve customers directly through our wholly owned credit services. The Nordstrom Rewards program contributes to our overall results, with members shopping more frequently and spending more on average than non-members. For the second consecutive year, we opened over one million new accounts. With 3.8 million active members, 2013 sales from members represented 38% of sales, increasing from 36% in 2012. Our overall credit card portfolio also remains healthy, with delinquency and write-off trends continuing to improve. We continue to believe strongly in our customer-centric strategy. To improve the customer experience, we continue to make investments in our stores, online and in new markets such as Canada and Manhattan. As a result of our planned growth across all of our channels, our business model continues to evolve to encompass these multiple channels in their various stages of growth. We project that these investments in our customer strategy will help us achieve long-term top-quartile shareholder returns through high single-digit total sales growth and mid-teens Return on Invested Capital. Our reportable segments are Retail and Credit. Our Retail segment includes our Nordstrom branded full-line stores and online store, Nordstrom Rack stores, Last Chance clearance store and other retail channels, including HauteLook and Jeffrey stores. For purposes of discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we combine our Retail segment results with revenues and expenses in the “Corporate/Other” column of our segment reporting footnote, which also includes our Canadian operations (collectively, the “Retail Business”). We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and Credit, while interest expense and income taxes are discussed on a total company basis. Similar to many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2012 (the “53rd week”). The analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources compares the 52 weeks in 2013 to the 53 weeks in 2012. However, the 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. In 2012, the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.04 to earnings per diluted share. As discussed in Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we reclassified amounts in our financial statements to better reflect the way we view and measure our business. As we continue to execute our long-term growth strategy and make investments across operating segments, aligning expenses with the associated benefits enhances our ability to evaluate segment performance. Historical results were also reclassified to match the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not impact net earnings, earnings per share, financial position or cash flows. We now allocate Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program expenses to our Retail Business. We previously recorded all Nordstrom Rewards expenses in our Credit segment. In addition, certain technology expenses we previously included in our Retail Business are now allocated to our Credit segment. These changes within our Retail Business and Credit segment did not impact the presentation of expenses in our consolidated financial statements. In our Credit segment, we previously presented bad debt expense associated with finance charges and fees as part of selling, general and administrative expenses. We reclassified these amounts and now present them as a reduction of credit card revenue. Our total net sales increase of 3.4% for 2013 was attributable to the same-store sales increase of 2.5%, driven by growth in our Direct channel and Nordstrom Rack’s accelerated store expansion. During the year, we opened 22 new Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated one Nordstrom full-line store and two Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions increased our square footage by 2.9% and represented 1.6% of our total net sales for 2013. The 53rd week in 2012 contributed approximately $162 in additional net sales. Nordstrom net sales, which consist of the full-line and Direct businesses, were $9,327 in 2013, an increase of 1.0% compared with 2012, with same-store sales up 2.3%. Strong growth in our Direct channel was partially offset by sales decreases at our full-line stores. Both the average selling price and number of items sold increased on a same-store basis in 2013 compared with 2012. Category highlights included Cosmetics, Men’s Shoes and Women’s Apparel. Full-line net sales for 2013 were $7,705, a decrease of 3.3% compared with 2012, while sales per square foot decreased 3.4%. Both were primarily driven by a same-store sales decrease of 2.1%. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores for 2013 were the Southwest and Southeast. The Direct channel continued to show strong sales growth with net sales of $1,622, an increase of 28% compared with 2012, with same-store sales up 30% on a comparable 52-week basis. These increases were driven by expanded merchandise selection and ongoing technology investments to enhance the customer experience. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,738, an increase of 12.0% compared with 2012 primarily due to 37 new store openings in the last two years. Same-store sales increased 2.7% for the year. Sales per square foot decreased 2.6% for the year as a result of the 53rd week in 2012, as well as the growth in new stores that typically take several years to reach the overall average of our mature stores. Cosmetics and Shoes were the strongest-performing categories for the year. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold on a same-store basis increased in 2013 compared with 2012. Net sales for 2012 increased 12.1% compared with 2011, driven by a same-store sales increase of 7.3% and strong performances across all channels. During 2012, we opened one Nordstrom full-line store, 15 Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated three Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions represented 1.5% of our total net sales for 2012, and increased our square footage by 2.2%. The 53rd week contributed approximately $162 in additional net sales. Nordstrom net sales for 2012 were $9,233, an increase of 9.6% compared with 2011, with same-store sales up 7.5%. Our sales growth was due in large part to the ongoing, consistent strength of our business both in store and online. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased on a same-store basis in 2012 compared with 2011. Category highlights included Handbags, Men’s Shoes, Men’s Apparel and Cosmetics. Full-line net sales for 2012 were $7,964, an increase of 6.0% compared with 2011, while sales per square foot increased 5.5%. Same-store sales increased 3.9% for the year. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores for 2012 were the South and Midwest. The Direct channel showed strong sales growth with net sales of $1,269, an increase of 39% compared with 2011, with same-store sales up 37% on a comparable 52-week basis. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,445, up 20% compared with 2011, while sales per square foot increased 4.2%. Same-store sales increased 7.4% for the year. Men’s Apparel, Shoes and Women’s Apparel were the strongest-performing categories for the year. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased on a same-store basis in 2012 compared with 2011. Capital expenditures, net of property incentives, of $840 to $880 million are expected in 2014, an increase from $714 in 2013. The majority of the increase represents investments to fuel online and Nordstrom Rack store growth in addition to our planned entry into Canada. To date in 2014, we have opened two Nordstrom Rack stores. We plan to open 27 Nordstrom Rack stores and three Nordstrom full-line stores in total during 2014. In February 2014, we announced our plans to close our full-line stores in Vancouver, Washington, and in Portland, Oregon, at the Lloyd Center, in January 2015. The planned net store openings are expected to increase our retail square footage by approximately 4.4%. We expect our planned entry into Canada to decrease earnings primarily due to ongoing infrastructure and pre-opening expenses. The estimated loss before interest and taxes for Canada is expected to be approximately $35 in 2014, compared with a loss before interest and taxes of $14 in 2013. This guidance also incorporates Nordstrom Rack’s accelerated store expansion and increased technology investments to improve service and experience across all channels. These expenses are expected to contribute to our overall increase in depreciation and rent expense of 14% compared with 2013. Interest expense, net is expected to decrease primarily due to a one-time charge of $14 related to the debt refinancing transaction in 2013.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2013-03-18.@Nordstrom is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise through our various channels: 'Nordstrom' branded full-line stores and online at www.nordstrom.com, 'Nordstrom Rack' off-price stores, 'Last Chance' clearance store, 'HauteLook' online private sale subsidiary, 'Jeffrey' boutiques and our 'treasure&bond' philanthropic store. Our stores are located in 31 states throughout the United States. In addition, we offer our customers a loyalty program along with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. Our 2012 results reflected the ongoing, consistent strength of our business. For the third consecutive year, we achieved double-digit growth in net sales and earnings per diluted share, added over one billion dollars in net sales and delivered same-store sales growth of over 7%. These accomplishments reflect the high level of execution across all channels and our ongoing investments in improving the customer experience as we seek to enhance the merchandise offering, increase relevance with existing and new customers, and aggressively grow our online capabilities. E-commerce is our fastest-growing business. We continued to make investments to improve the experience online by expanding our merchandise selection, enhancing the website and mobile experience with improvements to search, navigation and checkout, and increasing the speed of fulfillment and delivery. These investments helped drive same-store sales growth of 37% in our Direct channel on top of last year's 29% growth. We also continue to grow through new opportunities to increase our market share. We announced plans for our initial entry into Canada, beginning with four full-line stores and with the potential for a total of eight to 10 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores. In addition, we are again increasing the pace of expansion of our Rack stores with plans to grow to over 230 stores by the end of 2016. We also announced plans to open our first full-line store in Manhattan, which will increase our exposure within a premiere retail market. Our strong financial position enables us to invest in our stores through expansion, remodels and other initiatives to improve the customer experience. During 2012, we opened one Nordstrom full-line store, 15 Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated three Nordstrom Rack stores. Increasingly, we are using technology as an enabler of service. As an example, we now have mobile point-of-sale devices at all of our full-line and Rack stores to increase the speed at checkout and drive incremental volume. Additionally, mobile devices in our full-line stores have virtually the same functionality as our cash registers, and we continue to make progress in creating a fully mobile store environment. Our credit business also plays an important role in reaching new customers and strengthening existing customer relationships through our Fashion Rewards program, payment products and our ability to serve customers directly through our wholly owned credit services. The Fashion Rewards program contributes to our overall results, with members shopping more frequently and spending more on average than non-members. In 2012, net sales from our members increased 23% over the prior year. With the launch of our enhanced program in early 2012, we opened over one million new accounts, and ended the year with 3.3 million active members, a 27% increase over last year. Our overall credit card portfolio also remains healthy, with delinquency and write-off trends at pre-recession levels. Our ongoing focus on the customer drives the investments we are making to take advantage of multiple growth opportunities. The opportunities include Canada, Rack, e-commerce, Manhattan and other new full-line stores and provide a platform to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. As our business and operating model evolves with our growth, we remain focused on our overall financial goals of achieving high single-digit total sales growth and mid-teens Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC"), as these measures correlate strongly with shareholder return. Our reportable segments are Retail and Credit. Our Retail segment includes our Nordstrom branded full-line stores and website, our Nordstrom Rack stores, our Last Chance clearance store and our other retail channels including HauteLook, our Jeffrey stores and our treasure&bond store. For purposes of discussion and analysis of our results of operations, we combine our Retail segment results with revenues and expenses in the "Corporate/Other" column of our segment reporting footnote (collectively, the "Retail Business"). We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and earnings before income taxes for Credit, while interest expense and income taxes are discussed on a total company basis. Similar to many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2012 (the "53rd week"). The analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources compares the 53 weeks in 2012 to the 52 weeks in 2011. However, the 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. In 2012, the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.04 to earnings per diluted share.  Our total net sales increase of 12.1% for 2012 was driven by the same-store sales increase of 7.3% and strong performances across all channels. Our sales productivity continued to improve, reaching a high of $470 in sales per square foot in 2012 from increases in both our stores and online. During the year, we opened one Nordstrom full-line store, 15 Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated three Nordstrom Rack stores. These additions represented 1.5% of our total net sales for 2012, and increased our square footage by 2.2%. The 53rd week contributed approximately $162 in additional net sales. Nordstrom net sales for 2012 were $9,233, an increase of 9.6% compared with 2011, with same-store sales up 7.5%. Our sales growth was due in large part to the ongoing, consistent strength of our business both in store and online. We enhanced our Fashion Rewards loyalty program and expanded our relationship with our customers. At the same time, we made investments to improve the in-store, online and mobile experience. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased in 2012 compared with 2011. Category highlights included Handbags, Men's Shoes, Men's Apparel and Cosmetics. We also saw improvements in our Women's Apparel business in the second half of the year. Full-line net sales for 2012 were $7,964, an increase of 6.0% compared with 2011, with same-store sales up 3.9%. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores for 2012 were the South and Midwest. The Direct channel continued to show strong sales growth with net sales of $1,269, an increase of 39% compared with 2011, with same-store sales up 37% on a comparable 52-week basis. These increases significantly outpaced our overall performance and are reflective of how customers are responding to our ongoing e-commerce initiatives. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,445, an increase of 20% compared with 2011, while same-store sales increased 7.4% for the year. Men's Apparel, Shoes and Women's Apparel were the strongest performing categories for the year. Both the number of items sold and the average selling price increased in 2012 compared with 2011. Net sales for 2011 increased 12.7% compared with 2010, while same-store sales increased 7.2%. During 2011, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, 18 Nordstrom Rack stores and one treasure&bond store, relocated two Nordstrom Rack stores and acquired HauteLook. These additions represented 4.0% of our total net sales for 2011, and increased our square footage by 3.8%. Nordstrom net sales for 2011 were $8,426, up 9.4% compared with 2010, with same-store sales up 8.2%. Our sales growth was driven by our merchandising, inventory management and multi-channel initiatives as well as our efforts to build stronger relationships with customers and to improve the shopping experience across all channels. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased in 2011 compared with 2010. Category highlights included Designer, Handbags and Shoes. Full-line net sales for 2011 were $7,513, an increase of 7.4% compared with 2010, with same-store sales up 6.0%. The top-performing geographic regions for full-line stores for 2011 were the South and Midwest. The Direct channel continued to show strong sales growth with net sales of $913, an increase of 30% in 2011 compared with 2010. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,045, up 21% compared with 2010, while same-store sales increased 3.7% for the year. Shoes, Dresses and Accessories were the strongest performing categories for the year. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased in 2011 compared with 2010.  To date in 2013, we have opened two Nordstrom Rack stores. We plan to open more than 20 Nordstrom Rack stores (of which 16 have been formally announced) and relocate one Nordstrom full-line store and two Nordstrom Rack stores during 2013. The announced store openings will increase our retail square footage by approximately 2.2%. Included in our guidance are upfront infrastructure expenses for Canada, as well as organizational and incremental pre-opening expenses related to Rack's store expansion. In 2013, we expect these costs to be approximately $20 to $25. We expect our gross profit rate to decrease approximately 10 to 30 basis points. The decrease is expected as a result of an increasing mix of Nordstrom Rack stores and continued growth in our Fashion Rewards program. The decrease in our Retail SG&A rate relates to our expectation of leverage on higher sales. For our Credit segment, we expect credit card revenues to remain relatively consistent with 2012 and Credit SG&A expenses to increase $20 to $30 when compared with 2012 results given the $30 reduction in the allowance for credit losses recognized in 2012, with none expected for 2013. For the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2013, our ROIC increased to 13.9% compared with 13.3% for the 12 fiscal months ended January 28, 2012. Our ROIC increased compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in our earnings before interest and income tax expense. We believe that ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared with return on assets (net earnings divided by average total assets), it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. ROIC is one of our key financial metrics, and we also incorporate it into our executive incentive measures. We believe that overall performance as measured by ROIC correlates directly to shareholders' return over the long term. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, should not be considered a substitute for return on assets, net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The closest measure calculated using GAAP amounts is return on assets, which increased to 8.9% from 8.7% for the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2013, compared with the 12 fiscal months ended January 28, 2012. The following is a comparison of return on assets to ROIC:
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2012-03-16.@Nordstrom is a fashion specialty retailer offering high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise through various channels: our ‘Nordstrom’ branded full-line stores and website, our off-price ‘Nordstrom Rack’ stores, our online private sale subsidiary ‘HauteLook,’ our ‘Jeffrey’ boutiques and our philanthropic ‘treasure&bond’ store. Our stores are located in 30 states throughout the United States. In addition, we offer our customers a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards with an associated loyalty program. In 2011, we achieved record total net sales of $10,497, an increase of 12.7%, while growing earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) by 11.7%. This reflects our ongoing efforts to improve the customer experience across all channels, combined with consistent execution and various growth initiatives. As customers’ expectations of service evolve, the consistency of the customer experience across all channels becomes more important, including factors such as expanded selection, multi-channel capabilities, personalization, speed, convenience and price. To enhance the customer experience online, we have accelerated our investments in e-commerce. We acquired HauteLook, a leader in the online private sale marketplace. We believe this acquisition will help us further develop our mobile and e-commerce capabilities and enable us to participate in the fast-growing private sales channel. In the third quarter, we began offering free standard shipping and free returns for online purchases and did limited testing of same-day delivery. We also made enhancements to our website and mobile website. We believe these changes make it easier and more convenient to shop with us. Our combined efforts to enhance the online experience led to a meaningful sales increase in the online channel, which is where we expect to have the strongest percentage growth in the future. Our strong financial position enables us to continue to make investments in the customer experience to improve our store and online business while also growing through new stores, remodels and other initiatives. During 2011, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, eighteen Nordstrom Rack stores and remodeled six Nordstrom full-line stores. We also opened a philanthropic store in New York called treasure&bond. In 2012, we plan to open one Nordstrom full-line store and have announced twelve new Nordstrom Rack stores. In addition, we have announced plans to relocate two existing Nordstrom Rack stores and remodel eight Nordstrom full-line stores. Our overall goals are to achieve high single-digit total sales growth and mid-teens Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”). We believe that top-line growth and ROIC correlate strongly with shareholders’ return. As we continue to invest in new stores and remodels, we also want to enhance the customer experience through increased spending on e-commerce and technology. These investments flow through our expenses at a faster pace than other investments in previous years. We believe they will increase our ROIC through high growth in sales dollars and EBIT, as opposed to EBIT margin, with an incrementally productive capital base. Fashion Rewards plays an important part in building customer loyalty, and our Fashion Rewards members shop more frequently and spend more with us on average than non-members. Approximately one-third of our sales are from Fashion Rewards customers and the program continues to grow as more members use our tender as a convenient way to shop and earn rewards. During the year, customer payment rates continued to improve, resulting in decreasing delinquency and write-off trends, while our credit and debit card volumes increased. In January 2012, we enhanced our Fashion Rewards program, giving customers more control over how and when they can earn rewards and extending more benefits to our cardholders. As we look forward to 2012, we remain focused on improving customer service and providing a superior shopping experience. We have a customer-driven strategy, allowing us to execute our current operating plans across all channels while targeting investments in e-commerce and technology to enhance our platform for sustainable, profitable growth. Our reportable segments are Retail and Credit. Our Retail segment includes our Nordstrom branded full-line stores and website, our Nordstrom Rack stores, and our other retail channels including HauteLook, our Jeffrey stores and our treasure&bond store.

We analyze our results of operations through earnings before interest and income taxes for our Retail Business and earnings before income taxes for Credit, while interest expense and income taxes are discussed on a total company basis. Net sales for 2011 increased 12.7% compared with 2010 driven by the strength of our Nordstrom full-line stores, rapid growth in our online business and improving results at Nordstrom Rack. During the year, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, eighteen Nordstrom Rack stores and one treasure&bond store, relocated two Nordstrom Rack stores and acquired HauteLook. These additions represented 4.0% of our total net sales for 2011, and increased our gross square footage by 3.8%. Same-store sales increased 7.2%, with increases of 8.2% at Nordstrom and 3.7% at Nordstrom Rack. Nordstrom net sales for 2011 were $8,426, an increase of 9.4% compared with 2010, with same-store sales up 8.2%. Our sales growth was due in large part to our investments and efforts to build stronger relationships with customers and to improve the shopping experience across all channels. In addition, our merchandising, inventory management and multi-channel initiatives continue to drive our sales growth. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased in 2011 compared with 2010. Category highlights included Designer, Handbags and Shoes. The South and Midwest were the top-performing geographic regions for 2011. The Direct channel continued to outpace the overall Nordstrom increase, with a net sales increase of 29.5% in 2011 compared with 2010. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $2,045, an increase of 21.0% compared with 2010, while same-store sales increased 3.7% for the year. Shoes, Dresses and Accessories were the strongest performing categories for the year. Both the average selling price and the number of items sold increased in 2011 compared with 2010. Net sales for 2010 increased 12.7% compared with 2009, while same-store sales increased 8.1%. During the year, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, relocated one Nordstrom full-line store, opened seventeen Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated one Nordstrom Rack store. These stores represented 3.3% of our total net sales for 2010, and increased our gross square footage by 4.7%. Nordstrom net sales were $7,700, up 11.2% compared with 2009, with same-store sales up 9.3%. The number of items sold increased in 2010 compared with 2009, while the average selling price of Nordstrom merchandise was approximately flat. Category highlights included Jewelry, Shoes and Dresses. The Midwest and South were the top-performing geographic regions for 2010. Our sales growth was due in large part to the success of our merchandising, inventory management and multi-channel initiatives, including an updated inventory platform that allowed for shared inventory across all of our Nordstrom full-line stores and our website. These enhancements increased sales and led to significant improvements in our sell-through and inventory turnover rates beginning in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $1,720, up 19.5% compared with 2009, while same-store sales increased 0.7% for the year. Cosmetics and Shoes were the strongest performing categories for the year. The number of items sold increased in 2010 compared with 2009, partially offset by declines in the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise. We plan to open one Nordstrom full-line store and have announced plans to open twelve Nordstrom Rack stores and relocate two Nordstrom Rack stores during 2012. This will increase our retail square footage by approximately 2.2%. We expect our gross profit rate to decrease approximately 5 to 35 basis points, after the significant increases in 2011 and 2010. The decrease is expected as a result of an increasing mix of Nordstrom Rack stores, a reduction in shipping revenue as a result of launching free shipping and free returns for online purchases in 2011 and expenses related to our enhanced Fashion Rewards program. The majority of the increase in our Retail SG&A expenses relates to our expectations for increased variable expenses consistent with the planned increase in sales, additional expenses from stores opened during 2011 and 2012 and accelerated investments in our business to improve the customer experience both in store and online. For our Credit segment, we expect credit card revenues to be flat to slightly higher as a result of increased volume, offset by higher payment rates. We expect Credit SG&A expenses to increase $10 to $20 when compared with 2011 results as no planned reduction in our allowance for credit losses is expected while 2011 included $30 of reductions. Interest expense, net is anticipated to increase $25 to $30 due to higher debt levels and a higher average cost of debt. The guidance above includes the impact of the 53rd week of 2012, which we expect to add approximately $160 to $170 to net sales, and approximately $0.03 to $0.05 to earnings per diluted share.

In addition, we offer our customers a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards with an associated loyalty program. We started to experience positive momentum in our business in the second half of 2009, which continued throughout 2010, allowing us to achieve record sales and inventory turnover and increased gross profit. This reflected our ongoing efforts in multi-channel execution, merchandising and inventory management, combined with store expansion and other growth initiatives and, most important, improving customer service. We strive to provide an outstanding customer experience, regardless of channel, with a balanced offering of compelling new fashion and a high level of service. Our multi-channel capabilities allow us to better serve our customers by offering greater access to our inventory and making it easier for them to shop with us however and whenever they choose. We are continuing to invest in these capabilities as part of our commitment to provide a superior shopping experience. Our strong financial position has enabled us to continue to invest in our business during the economic downturn through store growth and remodels, technology, merchandising systems and other opportunities. During 2010, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores and seventeen Nordstrom Rack stores, and relocated one Nordstrom full-line store and one Nordstrom Rack store. Overall, our new stores are delivering a high return on investment while allowing us to expand our presence in top retail markets across the country. In 2011, we plan to open three Nordstrom full-line stores and seventeen Nordstrom Rack stores, and to relocate two Nordstrom Rack stores. We are also working to improve the customer experience by investing in areas such as mobile shopping and sales floor tools, social media and updated merchandise allocation and assortment systems in order to evolve with our customers’ changing needs and expectations. Our credit business began to recover during 2010 as economic conditions improved. Customer payment rates have returned to pre-recession levels, resulting in improved delinquency and write-off trends, while our credit and debit card volumes have increased. We continue to open accounts with high credit quality. In February 2011, we reached an agreement to acquire HauteLook, Inc., a leader in the online private sale marketplace. This acquisition, which we expect to close during the first quarter of 2011, will enable us to participate in this fast-growing channel and provide a platform that can lead to greater innovation and speed in the way we serve customers in all channels. We begin 2011 in a strong position and are gaining market share in a competitive retail industry. Our customer-driven model enables us to adapt quickly to the changing consumer environment. We continue to operate under a solid financial framework focused on creating a superior shopping experience for our customers and producing high returns for our shareholders.

Net sales for 2010 increased 12.7% compared with 2009. During the year, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, relocated one Nordstrom full-line store, opened seventeen Nordstrom Rack stores and relocated one Nordstrom Rack store. These stores represented 3.3% of our total net sales for 2010, and increased our gross square footage by 4.7%.

The number of sales transactions increased in 2010 compared with 2009, while the average selling price of Nordstrom merchandise was approximately flat. Category highlights included jewelry, shoes and dresses. The Midwest and South were the top-performing geographic regions for 2010. Our sales growth was due in large part to the success of our merchandising, inventory management and multi-channel initiatives. In the fall of 2009, we updated our inventory platform to allow for shared inventory across all of our Nordstrom full-line stores and our website, allowing us to fulfill online orders from any full-line store or from our fulfillment center. These enhancements increased sales and led to significant improvements in our sell-through and inventory turnover rates beginning in the second half of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $1,720, up 19.5% compared with 2009, while same-store sales increased 0.7% for the year. Cosmetics and shoes were the strongest performing categories for the year. The number of sales transactions increased in 2010 compared with 2009, partially offset by declines in the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise. Net sales for 2009 were approximately flat compared with 2008. During 2009, we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores and thirteen Nordstrom Rack stores. These stores represented 2.6% of our total net sales for 2009, and increased our gross square footage by 4.1% during 2009. Same-store sales decreased 4.2%, with a decrease of 5.0% at Nordstrom, partially offset by an increase of 2.5% at Nordstrom Rack. Nordstrom net sales were $6,923, down 2.9% compared with 2008, with same-store sales down 5.0%. Although the number of sales transactions increased compared with 2008, the average selling price of our Nordstrom merchandise decreased. During 2009, we made continued progress on our multi-channel strategy, providing our customers with easier access to more of our merchandise. These enhancements led to increased sales in the second half of the year. Category highlights included women’s shoes, dresses and jewelry. The South and Mid-Atlantic were the top-performing geographic regions for 2009. Nordstrom Rack net sales were $1,440, up 16.0% compared with 2008, with same-store sales up 2.5%. The shoes and women’s apparel categories led the positive performance for the year. In 2009, both the average selling price of Nordstrom Rack merchandise and the number of sales transactions increased compared with 2008. We plan to open three Nordstrom full-line stores and seventeen Nordstrom Rack stores and relocate two Nordstrom Rack stores during 2011. This will increase our retail square footage by approximately 4.3%. We expect our gross profit rate to remain approximately flat in 2011, after the significant improvement experienced in 2010. The majority of the increase in our Retail SG&A expenses relates to our expectations for increased variable expenses consistent with the planned increase in sales, to additional expenses from stores opened during 2010 and 2011, and to strengthening our capabilities to enable continued improvement in the customer experience. For our Credit segment, we expect a slight increase in credit card revenues as a result of increased volume, offset by higher payment rates. We expect Credit SG&A expenses to be flat to down slightly when compared with 2010 results, which included $45 of reductions in our allowance for credit losses. Interest expense, net is anticipated to be flat to down slightly due primarily to lower borrowing facility fees.

We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise. We offer our products through various channels: our ‘Nordstrom’ branded full-line stores and Web site (which we refer to as “multi-channel”), our off-price ‘Nordstrom Rack’ stores, and our ‘Jeffrey’ boutiques. Our stores are located throughout the United States. In addition, we offer our customers a loyalty program associated with a variety of payment products and services, including credit and debit cards. We believe our multi-channel offering is important to our success and is consistent with our commitment to customer service. Our goal is to provide a seamless integrated shopping experience to our customers whenever and however they choose to shop. With that in mind, we are continuing to make improvements to our multi-channel capabilities. In 2008, we launched the “Buy Online, Pick Up in Store” service, which allows customers to purchase merchandise online and then pick up their item(s) at a Nordstrom store on the same day. In 2009, we updated our inventory platform to create shared inventory across all of our full-line stores and our online store, allowing us to fulfill online orders from any full-line store. These enhancements have led to greater merchandise selections online, improved convenience, as well as significant improvements in our sell-through rates (the proportion of available merchandise that we are able to sell) and inventory turnover. Our merchandising efforts have also been a significant contributor to our recent success. By managing our inventory levels effectively during the economic downturn that began approximately two years ago, we were well positioned to increase purchases as sales improved and maintain fresh merchandise in our stores without taking excessive markdowns. Our customers have continued to respond favorably to our merchandise assortment, thereby contributing to additional sales growth and higher rates of regular-priced sales. Throughout 2009, we demonstrated discipline in the management of our expenses. Our model is focused on controlling our fixed expenses, while flexing our variable and performance-related expenses with our sales and earnings results. Our sales per square foot in 2009 declined to $368, consistent with our sales per square foot of $369 in 2004. However, as a result of our expense management efforts, we decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses per square foot for our Retail Stores, Direct and Other segments over the same time period, from $100 in 2004 to $94 in 2009. This flexibility in managing our business and the ability to adjust quickly to changes in trends have put us in a healthy position heading into 2010. The economic environment continues to have a significant impact on our customers. Consumers are cautious about spending, unemployment levels continue to be high and economic uncertainty remains. As a result of these conditions, we experienced elevated delinquency and write-off rates on our credit card portfolio. We expect unemployment levels will remain elevated during 2010. We recognize the importance of increasing our presence in top retail markets across the country. During 2009 we opened three Nordstrom full-line stores, relocated another, and opened 13 Nordstrom Racks. In 2010 we will continue to open full-line and Rack stores while returning to a more regular remodeling schedule of five-to-six in 2010, compared to one remodel in 2009, as we continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy. We entered 2009 with considerable uncertainty, including an economic downturn and a volatile retail environment. Our continued focus on improving service through our multi-channel offering, improved merchandising and disciplined inventory, expense and capital management, enabled us to adapt as our trends improved, and as a result we are well positioned going into 2010. Following a year of improving performance and with a more efficient business model, we are focused on improving execution and growing our market share. We believe that our response to the adversity of the past two years has left us better positioned financially, competitively, and most important, with our customers. Our Retail Stores segment includes our full-line, Rack and Jeffrey stores; our Direct segment includes our online store; and our Other segment includes our product development group and corporate center operations (collectively the “Retail Business”). The following table summarizes the combined sales and expenses of our Retail Business for the fiscal years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008: Net sales for 2009 were approximately flat compared to 2008. The decline in multi-channel same-store sales was mostly offset by new store openings during 2009 and an increase in same-store sales for Rack. Our multi-channel same-store sales declined 5.0% compared to 2008 as the decrease at our full-line stores was partially offset by the strong performance of Direct. During 2009, we made continued progress on our multi-channel strategy, providing our customers with access to more of our merchandise. In the fall of 2009, we updated our inventory platform to allow for shared inventory across all of our full-line stores and our Web site, allowing us to fulfill online orders from any full-line store or from our fulfillment center. These enhancements increased sales and led to significant improvements in our sell-through rates and inventory turnover, following their implementation in the second half of the year. Our merchandising efforts also contributed to our improving multi-channel sales trends during the second half of the year. By managing our inventory levels effectively during the downturn in sales over the past two years, we had the flexibility to increase purchases as sales improved and maintain current merchandise in our stores without taking excessive markdowns. As a result, our percentage of regular price sales improved measurably over the course of the year. Same-store sales for our full-line stores decreased 7.2% compared to the same period last year. Highlights for the year included both women’s shoes and accessories. Women’s shoes benefited from sales of high-end shoes and boots, while fashion jewelry led accessories. Men’s clothing, particularly young contemporary wear and men’s furnishings, remained challenging throughout the year. This continues the trend we experienced last year as sales of men’s clothing declined in conjunction with economic deterioration. The South and Mid-Atlantic regions were the top performing geographic areas for full-line stores. California and the Northwest had same-store sales below the full-line store average in 2009, although we saw improvements in both regions during the latter part of the year. Direct’s net sales increased 14.5% for the year, with results driven by the accessories, women’s apparel and women’s shoes categories. Accessories benefited from the sales of handbags and fashion jewelry while women’s apparel was led by special occasion dresses. Junior footwear and high-end shoes drove the improvement in women’s shoes. The growth in our Direct business was helped by our investments in technology and systems to better align our merchandise offering and improve the online shopping experience. Rack had its eighth consecutive year of positive sales growth with a same-store sales increase of 2.5% for the year. The shoes and women’s apparel categories led the positive performance for the year. Junior and active footwear drove shoes while women’s apparel benefited from knitwear and blouses. During 2009 we opened three full-line and thirteen Rack stores. These stores represent 2.6% of our total net sales for 2009, and increased our gross square footage by 4.1% during 2009. Net sales declined 6.3% in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was due to same-store sales declines in our full-line stores, partially offset by increases in same-store sales for Rack and Direct, as well as new store openings. Same-store sales for our full-line stores decreased 12.4% compared to the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of the economic downturn. The largest same-store sales decreases came in women’s apparel and men’s apparel. Women’s apparel continued to experience a market-wide deterioration and we saw a decline in men’s apparel correspond to the economic downturn, particularly during the fourth quarter. Regionally, business trends were most challenging in markets undergoing the largest housing price corrections. California was the most challenging region throughout 2008, with same-store sales below the full-line store average. All other regions were above the same-store sales average for full-line stores. Direct net sales increased 8.4% in 2008, driven by our efforts to better align our merchandise offering and experience with our full-line stores. Our new “Buy Online, Pick Up in Store” service was launched in 2008 and proved to be a convenient and valued service for our customers. The accessories, women’s apparel and kids’ merchandise categories led the growth in our Direct sales in 2008. Rack same-store sales increased 3.1% for the year in 2008. The accessories category, led by designer handbags, and men’s apparel category, led by premium denim, drove this growth. All regions contributed to the positive same-store sales results. During 2008 we opened eight full-line and six Rack stores. These stores represented 3.3% of our total net sales for fiscal 2008, and increased our gross square footage by 6.7% during 2008. We expect 2010 same-store sales to increase approximately 2% to 4%. The same-store sales increase in the first half of 2010 is expected to be approximately 300 basis points higher than in the second half of 2010. As of March 19, 2010, we have opened three Rack stores. In total, we plan to open three full-line stores, relocate one full-line store and open fourteen additional Rack stores during the remainder of 2010. This will increase retail square footage by approximately 4.5%.
 .@0000072333.@JWN.@2009-03-23.@The business environment during 2008 was both challenging and volatile. The first half of the year was relatively stable with quarterly same-store sales decreasing between 6.0% and 6.5%. The second half of 2008 was more volatile as consumers reduced their discretionary spending due to economic concerns and uncertainty, and retailers struggled to align their businesses with significantly lower levels of demand. As a result, our quarterly same-store sales in the second half of 2008 declined between 11.1% and 12.5% and our gross profit was negatively impacted. In response, we needed to make tough choices in the near term while remaining true to our long-term strategy. Even in a challenging and uncertain economy, our strategy remains unchanged in its focus on customers and building strong relationships with them. We strive to provide superior service and compelling merchandise within existing product categories in an effort to grow our share of business with core customers. While the conditions in 2008 required that we significantly reduce expenses, inventory and planned capital expenditures, we believe we have done so while preserving our standards of service, product and shopping experience. Our variable cost business model provides flexibility that helps mitigate the impact of slower sales trends on profit margins and cash flows. While we believe our model adjusts well to changing market trends, we took additional actions on expenses, working capital and planned capital expenditures to further mitigate operating margin pressure, improve operating cash flow and maintain a healthy balance sheet. We ended the fiscal year with inventory levels aligned with current sales trends. We followed a disciplined approach to finding and executing expense reduction opportunities and will continue these efforts through 2009. Given the current economic conditions, our capital expenditures in 2009 will be significantly reduced compared to our plan last year. These changes include reducing the number of major full-line store remodels from approximately six per year to approximately two per year. Additionally, the economic environment has affected our real estate development partners, who have delayed or canceled several of our planned new full-line stores. We are continuously monitoring our capital expenditure plans as economic conditions change. Although we have reduced our planned capital expenditures overall, we did not reduce our maintenance expenditures budget, as it is important that we maintain the look, feel and experience of shopping in our stores. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to weather the economic downturn, while maintaining an unwavering focus on our customers and positioning the company for the future. Full year earnings before income taxes (“EBT”) decreased $525 from $1,173 in 2007 to $648 in 2008. The Retail Stores, Direct and Other segments produced $491 of this decrease due to lower sales and increased markdowns, partially offset by decreased variable costs and savings in fixed expenses. Our Credit segment contributed $34 of the decline in EBT, as our credit card yields were negatively impacted by higher bad debt expense and lower interest rates. As described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we have reclassified credit card revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings to more clearly present our credit card business. Credit card revenues include finance charges, late and other fees generated by our combined Nordstrom private label card and Nordstrom VISA credit card programs, and interchange fees generated by the use of Nordstrom VISA cards at third-party merchants. These revenues were previously included in finance charges and other, net in our consolidated statement of earnings. Selling, general and administrative expenses for our credit segment consist of operational and marketing costs incurred to support and service our credit card programs and bad debt expense, and were previously included in total selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. Net sales declined 6.3% in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was due to same-store sales declines in our full-line stores, partially offset by increases in same-store sales for Rack and Direct, as well as new store openings. Same-store sales for our full-line stores decreased 12.4% compared to the same period last year. The largest same-store sales decreases came in women’s apparel and men’s apparel. Women’s apparel continues to experience a market-wide downturn and we have seen a decline in men’s apparel correspond to the economic downturn, particularly during the fourth quarter. Regionally, business trends were most challenging in markets undergoing the largest housing price corrections. California was the most challenging region throughout 2008, with same-store sales below the full-line store average. All other regions were above the same-store sales average for full-line stores. Our Rack channel had its seventh consecutive year of positive sales growth with a same-store sales increase of 3.1% for the year. Rack purchases merchandise from third parties and also serves as a clearance channel for our full-line stores. The accessories and men’s apparel categories drove this growth. Designer handbags led accessories and premium denim led men’s apparel. All regions contributed to the positive same-store sales results. Our Direct channel net sales increased 8.4% for the year, with results driven by accessories, women’s apparel and kids’ merchandise categories. The growth in our Direct business was driven by our efforts to better align our merchandise offering and experience with our full-line stores. Our new “Buy Online, Pick Up in Store” service proved to be a convenient and valued service for our customers over the holiday gift-giving season. During 2008 we opened eight new full-line and six new Rack stores. These new stores represent 3.3% of our total net sales for fiscal 2008, and increased our gross square footage by 6.7% during 2008. Total net sales increased 3.1% as a result of same-store sales increases as well as from the three full-line stores and one Rack store opened during fiscal 2007. The 2006 fiscal calendar had 53 weeks compared to our normal operating calendar of 52 weeks. In the 53rd week of 2006, we had sales of $118. Excluding the extra week of sales in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 4.6% in fiscal year 2007. The 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. Our full-line stores had a 2.5% same-store sales increase in 2007, on top of a 5.9% increase in 2006. The Midwest, South and Northwest were our strongest performing regions during 2007. By category, our largest same-store sales increases came from our designer apparel, women’s accessories and men’s apparel categories. Designer apparel offers fashion-forward and aspirational products, and customer demand for these products was strong. Women’s accessories benefited from increased sales of handbags and fashion jewelry. The increase in men’s apparel was in part due to growth in our younger contemporary offering. Our Rack same-store sales increased 8.7% in 2007, following a 10.9% increase in 2006. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Same-store sales were consistent across all regions, which showed high single-digit increases. The largest same-store sales increases were in accessories and men’s apparel. High performance bodywear, watches and sunglasses led the accessories category. The men’s increase reflects sales from premium denim, suits and dress shirts. Nordstrom Direct’s 2007 total net sales increased 17.9% to $644. The growth in our Direct business was driven by our efforts to better align our online shopping environment with the customer experience in our full-line stores. This includes aligning our merchandise offering with the full-line stores to create a seamless experience for customers. During 2007 we opened three new full-line stores and one new Rack store. These new stores represent 1.0% of our total net sales for fiscal 2007, and increased our gross square footage by 2.6% during 2007. As of March 20, 2009, we have relocated one full-line store and opened two new Rack stores. In total, we plan to open three new full-line stores and eight additional Rack stores during the year. This will increase retail square footage by approximately 3.7%. We expect 2009 same-store sales to decrease approximately 10% to 15%. Based on the pace of business in 2008, same-store sales in the first half of 2009 are expected to be 300 to 400 basis points lower than the projected annual rate. The business environment during the fourth quarter challenged the retail industry and our company. Our earnings per diluted share were $0.31 for the quarter ended January 31, 2009 compared to $0.92 in the same period last year. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $68 compared with $212 in 2007. Total sales for the quarter decreased 8.5% to $2,301 while same-store sales declined 12.5%. Results in full-line stores continued to be challenging, as same-store sales decreased 15.8% for the quarter. Nordstrom Rack remained one of the top performers amongst its off-price competition with a same-store sales decrease of 1.5%. Women’s apparel and shoes were the Rack categories with same-store sales above the Rack average. Net sales for the Direct segment increased 9.7%, led by the shoes and kids’ apparel divisions. Our gross profit rate declined to 32.0% from 37.6% last year as we responded to slower sales trends and the competitive environment with increased markdowns. We continued to make good progress in aligning inventory levels with sales trends, ending the quarter with inventory per square foot down 12% from the fourth quarter of 2007. Selling, general and administrative dollars for our Retail Stores, Direct and Other segments were approximately flat compared to last year, while these expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 191 basis points from 23.3% to 25.2%. Although we continued to vigorously control our expenses in the fourth quarter, the impact of declining sales resulted in the rate increase. Our new stores expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $20, which offset expense savings during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses for our credit segment were $90, up from $52 in 2007. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt expense from increased delinquencies and write-offs.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2008-03-21.@In 2007, we continued to grow our business despite operating in a more challenging consumer and retail environment compared to past years. A slower economic environment weighed on the overall market, resulting in softer trends throughout the retail industry in the second half of the year. Our ability to provide a focused and edited merchandise offering, incorporating the best of what the marketplace has to offer in terms of fashion, quality and brands, has contributed to our results in this and past years. Our customers want the best merchandise available. Key highlights for 2007 include: We achieved positive same-store sales growth for the sixth year in a row. Same-store sales increased 3.9% on top of our 7.5% increase in 2006 and our 6.0% increase in 2005. Increased markdowns at our full-line stores led to a 6 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 9 basis points primarily from lower incentives tied to company performance, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Full year net earnings increased 5.5% as a result of same-store sales increases, the openings of three full-line stores during 2007, and lower incentive costs tied to company performance. Earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% over last year to $2.88. We repurchased 39 shares totaling $1,728 during the year, which had a $0.07 positive impact on earnings per diluted share. Like many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in fiscal 2006 (the 53rd week). The 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. Our full-line stores had a 2.5% same-store sales increase in 2007, on top of 5.9% in the same period in 2006. The Midwest, South and Northwest were our strongest performing regions during 2007. By category, our largest same-store sales increases came from our designer apparel, women’s accessories and men’s merchandise categories. The designer category, which benefited from additional investment as an important component of our merchandise strategy, had a double-digit same-store sales increase. Designer apparel offers fashion-forward and aspirational products, which drove the increase. Women’s accessories benefited from increased sales of handbags and fashion jewelry. The increase in men’s apparel was in part due to growth in our younger contemporary offering. Our Rack same-store sales increased 8.7% in 2007, in addition to last year’s 10.9% increase. Rack purchases the majority of its merchandise from third parties and serves as a clearance channel for our full-line stores. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Same-store sales were consistent across all regions, which showed high single-digit increases. Merchandise categories driving the largest same-store sales increases for Rack were the accessories and cosmetics category and the men’s category. The men’s increase reflects sales from premium denim, suits and dress shirts. High performance bodywear, watches and sunglasses led the accessories and cosmetics categories. Nordstrom Direct’s 2007 total net sales increased 16.7% to $633. The growth in our Direct business was driven by our efforts to better align our online shopping environment with the customer experience in our full-line stores. This includes aligning our merchandise offering with the full-line stores to create a seamless experience for customers. Total company net sales increased 3.1% as a result of our same-store sales increases as well as from the three full-line stores and one Rack store opened during fiscal 2007. The 2006 fiscal calendar had 53 weeks compared to our normal operating calendar of 52 weeks. In the 53rd week of 2006, we had sales of $118. Excluding the extra week of sales in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 4.6% in fiscal year 2007. All of our full-line store regions and most of our full-line store merchandise categories had same-store sales increases. Our full-line stores had a 5.9% same-store sales increase, ahead of 5.4% in 2005. Our compelling merchandise offering, combined with customer service, drove sales increases throughout our business, particularly in accessories, cosmetics and men’s apparel. The largest increase was in our accessories category, driven by handbags and sunglasses. Cosmetics benefited from increases in the artistry and prestigious branded lines. Additionally, the men’s increase came from men’s contemporary, including fashion denim and t-shirts. Our Rack same-store sales increased 10.9% in 2006, on top of an increase of 14.8% in 2005. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Our online store sales drove Nordstrom Direct’s 2006 total net sales increase of 23.5%. Our online sales benefited from the overall Internet marketplace expansion, driven by the continued adoption of higher-speed Internet connections which allow for convenient and efficient shopping, as well as utilization of the Internet as a tool for research and information before making a purchase decision. Catalog sales experienced an overall decline because we reduced our catalog mailings beginning in the middle of 2005. Total net sales increased 10.8% as a result of our same-store sales increases as well as from the five full-line stores and one Rack store opened since February 2006. We also relocated one full-line store and expanded one Rack store, which contributed to our increase in total net sales. In the 53rd week, we had sales of $118. Sales for the 53rd week represented 1.5% of the total percentage increase versus 2005. Our gross profit rate is made up of both merchandise margin rate and buying and occupancy cost rate. Compared to last year, our gross profit rate declined 6 basis points, driven primarily by markdowns at our full-line stores. During the year we experienced increasing inventory levels coupled with slower sales trends. To realign our inventory levels, we took higher markdowns during the last half of the year. The increase in markdowns was offset by a decrease in our buying and occupancy costs. The decrease in these expenses related to performance-based incentives and lower expense resulting from the sale of our Façonnable business. The increase in our average inventory per square foot supports the growth of our designer business in apparel, accessories and shoes. Although we encountered softer sales trends during the latter half of 2007, inventory discipline and growth in sales throughout the year resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate, which increased 1.9%. Our gross profit rate improved 75 basis points, driven primarily by expansion of our merchandise margin rate. All major merchandise categories contributed to this rate expansion. Our women’s apparel category experienced significant rate expansion in the second half of the year due to strategy changes that brought a sharper focus to our merchandise offering, resulting in more regular price selling and fewer markdowns. For the first time, in 2006 our buying and occupancy costs included expenses related to stock options awarded primarily to our merchant and product development groups. These costs were $12 and impacted our gross profit rate by 14 basis points. Despite this additional expense, our buying and occupancy cost rate also improved, driven by sales growth relative to our mostly fixed buying and occupancy costs. Sales growth and continued inventory discipline resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate, which increased 4.5%. In 2008, we expect a net 30 to 60 basis point decrease in our gross profit rate as we will have additional occupancy costs from the eight full-line stores and three Rack stores we will open in 2008. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $212 compared with $232 in 2006. Total sales for the quarter decreased 4.4% to $2,514 and same-store sales were approximately flat. The 2006 fiscal calendar had 53 weeks compared to our normal operating calendar of 52 weeks; therefore, the fourth quarter of 2006 included an extra week (“the 53rd week”). Excluding the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, total sales were flat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Our designer apparel, accessories, and women’s shoe merchandise categories experienced the largest same-store sales increases. Designer apparel features luxury and high-fashion products. Handbags led the accessories category while women’s shoes benefited from the sale of comfort boots. Our gross profit rate declined to 37.6% from 38.3% last year. Merchandise margin decreased versus the prior year, driven mainly by higher markdowns. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 68 basis points from 26.0% to 25.4%. The primary driver was lower incentives tied to company performance, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Although our overall credit card quality is above average, we experienced higher delinquency and loss rates in the fourth quarter of 2007. However, these were in line with our expectations and, the overall quality of our credit portfolio remains high. We believe that ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented. When read in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared to return on assets, it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. In the past three years, we have incorporated ROIC into our key financial metrics, and since 2005 have used it as an executive incentive measure. Overall performance as measured by ROIC correlates directly to shareholders’ return over the long term. For the 12 fiscal months ended February 2, 2008, our ROIC decreased to 19.4% compared to 20.9% for the 12 months ended February 3, 2007. Our ROIC decreased primarily due to a lower percentage increase in earnings before interest and income taxes compared to the percentage increase in average invested capital. The increase in average invested capital in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to the securitization transaction on May 1, 2007, which brought the entire portfolio of co-branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables on-balance sheet as of that date. ROIC, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for return on assets, net earnings or total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See our ROIC reconciliation to GAAP below. The closest GAAP measure is return on assets, which decreased to 13.1% from 14.0% for the last 12 months ended February 2, 2008 compared to the 12 months ended February 3, 2007.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2007-03-23.@For the first time in our history, our earnings before income tax expense exceeded $1 billion in 2006. This result was driven primarily by the combination of continued sales growth, gross profit rate expansion and leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses. Key highlights include: We achieved positive same-store sales growth for the fifth year in a row. Same-store sales increased 7.5% on top of our 6.0% increase in 2005 and our 8.5% increase in 2004. Our gross profit rate increased 75 basis points primarily due to merchandise margin expansion. With the sales growth mentioned above, we leveraged our overhead costs, resulting in a 37 basis point improvement in our selling, general and administrative expense rate. Full year earnings per diluted share increased 28.8% over last year to $2.55. Like many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in fiscal 2006 (the 53rd week). The 53rd week is not included in same-store sales calculations. All of our Full-Line store regions and most of our Full-Line store merchandise categories had same-store sales increases. Our Full-Line stores had a 5.9% same-store sales increase, ahead of last year’s result of 5.4%. Some other retailers who combine an offering of high-end merchandise and customer service continued to experience positive sales growth in 2006. Our largest same-store sales increases came from our accessories, cosmetics and men’s apparel merchandise categories. Women’s apparel experienced same-store sales decreases in the first half of the year, but had same-store sales increases in the second half, resulting in a low single digit increase for the full year. The designer category, which benefited from additional investment because it is an important component of our merchandise strategy, had a double-digit same-store sales increase. Our Rack same-store sales increased 10.9% in 2006, on top of last year’s 14.8% increase. Rack purchases the majority of its merchandise from third-parties and serves as a clearance channel for our Full-Line stores. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Our online store sales drove Nordstrom Direct’s 2006 total net sales increase of 23.0%. Our online sales benefited from the overall Internet marketplace expansion, driven by the continued adoption of higher-speed Internet connections which allow for convenient and efficient shopping, as well as utilization of the Internet as a tool for research and information before making a purchase decision. Catalog sales experienced an overall decline because we reduced our catalog mailings beginning in the middle of 2005. Total net sales increased 10.8% as a result of our same-store sales increases as well as from the five Full-Line stores and one Rack store opened since February 2005. We also relocated one Full-Line store and expanded one Rack store, which contributed to our increase in total net sales. In the 53rd week, we had sales of $117.7. Sales for the 53rd week represented 1.5% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. In our Full-Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and men’s apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same-store sales increases. Our shoes division had same-store sales increases. Our women’s apparel merchandise category had mixed same-store sales performance; women’s intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the women’s category, while women’s special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same-store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same-store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of an increase of 13.2% in 2004. Our sales increase was driven by the Rack’s merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Direct’s 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, increased by 1.1%. Online store sales had a double-digit increase. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional online sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. As part of the multi-channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full-Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to our online store, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales also increased as a result of our same-store sales increases as well as from the six Full-Line stores opened since February 2004. In 2007, we plan to open three Full-Line stores and one Rack store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 2.4%. We are assuming low single digit same-store sales growth in our Full-Line and Rack stores, with a higher growth rate for Nordstrom Direct. In total, we expect 2007 same-store sales to increase 3% to 4%. Our gross profit rate improved 75 basis points, driven primarily by expansion of our merchandise margin rate. All major merchandise categories contributed to this rate expansion, in part due to an increase of regular price merchandise sales. Our women’s apparel category experienced significant rate expansion in the second half of the year due to strategy changes that brought a sharper focus to our merchandise offering. For the first time, this year our buying and occupancy costs included expenses related to stock options awarded primarily to our merchant and product development groups. These costs were $11.9 and impacted our gross profit rate by 14 basis points. Despite this additional expense, we leveraged our buying and occupancy costs on sales growth. Sales growth and continued inventory discipline resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate, which increased 4.5%. While we showed growth in our same-store sales in 2005, we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with 2004. In addition, our merchandise costs increased in-line with our sales increases. As a result, we drove a gross profit rate improvement of 60 basis points. Our inventory turnover rate improved 7.3% in 2005, indicating that our merchandise planning and execution have continued to improve. In 2007, if we achieve our planned same-store sales growth, we expect a net 30 to 40 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate from continued sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs along with improved merchandise margin. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $232.3 compared with $190.4 in 2005. Total sales for the quarter increased 14.6% to $2,630.9 and same-store sales increased by 8.3%. Sales in the 53rd week of $117.7 represented 5.1% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. Strong regular price sales across all major merchandise categories throughout the quarter and a successful holiday season resulted in same-store sales growth above our overall sales plan. Our designer apparel, accessories, men’s apparel, and cosmetics merchandise categories experienced the largest same-store sales increases. As it did in the third quarter, our women’s apparel category had a mid-single digit increase. Our gross profit rate increased to 38.3% from 37.5% last year. Merchandise margin improved versus the prior year, driven mainly by lower markdowns and higher sell-through of inventory, especially in women’s apparel. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 20 basis points from 26.2% to 26.0%. Overall, expenses during the fourth quarter trended in line with the improved performance in sales and gross profit compared to last year. Performance-based incentive compensation costs driven by goals for total year results and share price appreciation accelerated above plan, as fiscal 2006 sales, gross profit, and earnings before income tax expense results exceeded our plan.
.@0000072333.@JWN.@2006-03-24.@In 2005, our same-store sales increased 6.0% on top of our 8.5% increase in 2004. These increases are our two highest annual same-store sales growth results in the past 10 years. Some other retailers who combine an offering of compelling merchandise and customer service have also experienced positive sales growth. Our merchandise and selling costs increased in-line with our same-store sales, but our other costs, including buying and occupancy costs and non-selling labor, remained relatively consistent with last year. As a result of our same-store sales growth and expense performance, we experienced a significant increase in our operating income. Our earnings before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales was 11.5% in 2005, the first year that it exceeded 10.0% since we first issued stock to the public in 1971. In addition, our diluted earnings per share increased 43.5% to $1.98. In our Full-Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and men’s apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same-store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same-store sales increases. Our women’s apparel merchandise category had mixed same-store sales performance; women’s intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the women’s category, while women’s special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same-store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same-store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of last year’s 13.2% increase. Our sales increase was driven by the Rack’s merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Direct’s 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, decreased by 2.5%. Internet sales increased 40.7%. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional Internet sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. Nordstrom Direct’s 2005 sales, excluding shipping revenue, improved by 2.4% compared to 2004. As part of the multi-channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full-Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to the Internet, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales increased as a result of our same-store sales increases as well as from the six Full-Line stores opened since February 2004. Our net sales increased as our customers responded positively to our merchandise offerings. Both our Full-Line and Rack stores had overall and same-store sales increases. All of our geographic regions and major merchandise categories also reported overall and same-store sales increases. The strongest performing areas were accessories, women’s shoes and women’s better apparel, followed by women’s designer and men’s apparel. Total net sales also benefited from the six Full-Line stores and two Rack stores opened since February 2003, increasing our retail square footage 5% during the last two years. Sales at Nordstrom Direct increased 30.9% due to Internet-customer order growth and an improved customer order fulfillment rate. Internet sales increased 53.1% due to an increase in the rate of Web site visits that result in sales and increased Internet advertising. Catalog net sales decreased in 2004 by 3%, which is consistent with our strategy to shift catalog customers to the Internet. In March 2006, we opened one Full-Line store; later in 2006, we plan to open one Rack store and relocate one existing Full-Line store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 1%. We expect 2006 same-store sales to increase 1% to 3%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $190.4 million compared with $140.0 million in 2004. Total sales for the quarter increased 9.3% to $2.3 billion and same-store sales increased by 5.8%. Our cosmetics, accessories and men’s apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same-store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same-store sales increases. Our women’s apparel merchandise categories had mixed same-store sales performance. Women’s intimate and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the women’s category, while women’s special sizes, bridge and better apparel had same-store sales decreases in 2005. Our gross profit rate increased to 37.5% from 36.6% last year. Our women’s apparel category experienced a reduction in gross profit rate, but this was offset by improvement in the men’s apparel and accessories categories. The quarterly improvement in our gross profit rate resulted from leverage on our buying and occupancy expenses. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 70 basis points from 26.9% to 26.2%, primarily from leverage on our general and administrative expenses.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2019-03-01.@We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties in 130 countries and territories under 30 brand names. Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and Asia Pacific. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Caribbean and Latin America operating segments do not individually meet the criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments. We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. In most markets, base management and franchise fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue, or certain property-level revenue in the case of franchise fees, while incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit after a specified owner return. In our Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific regions, incentive management fees typically consist of a percentage of gross operating profit without adjustment for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (also referred to as “house profit,” which we discuss under the “Performance Measures” section below) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling our investments maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility. We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). We provide our guests new and memorable experiences through our portfolio of brands, innovative technology, personalized guest recognition, and access to travel experiences through our Marriott Bonvoy Moments program. Our brands remain strong due to our skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior guest service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Loyalty Program, multichannel reservation systems, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities, technology offerings, and guest experiences. We address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet our standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements. Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Managed properties in our system continue to maintain tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. We believe RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. Our RevPAR statistics for 2018, 2017, and 2016, include Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for each of the full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Merger Date. Therefore, our RevPAR statistics include Legacy-Starwood properties for periods during which fees from the Legacy-Starwood properties are not included in our Income Statements. We provide these RevPAR statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. Comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the Starwood Combination, that were open and operating under one of our Legacy-Marriott or Legacy-Starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2017 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. For 2018 compared to 2017, we had 4,109 comparable North American properties and 1,173 comparable International properties. For 2017 compared to 2016, we had 3,883 comparable North American properties and 1,030 comparable International properties. We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. The following discussion presents an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2018, 2017, and 2016. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), our Income Statements include Legacy-Starwood’s results of operations from the Merger Date. All references to the effect of Legacy-Starwood operations on our 2017 results refer to the incremental amounts contributed by Legacy-Starwood operations in 2017 over the effect of Legacy-Starwood operations on our results for the period from the Merger Date through December 31, 2016. The following discussion also reflects our adoption of several new accounting standards. See the “New Accounting Standards Adopted” caption in Footnote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. Our 2017 results were favorably impacted by the non-recurring gain on the disposition of our ownership interest in Avendra, discussed in Footnote 3. Dispositions and Acquisitions. We committed to the owners of the hotels in our system that the benefits derived from Avendra, including any dividends or sale proceeds above our original investment, would be used for the benefit of the hotels in our system. Accordingly, in 2018 we used $115 million ($85 million after-tax) of the net proceeds, and we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds, for the benefit of our system of hotels. Spending under those plans is, and will be, expensed in the “Reimbursed expenses” caption of our Income Statements, causing a reduction in our profitability in the periods it is expensed. The $38 million increase in base management fees primarily reflected $29 million from unit growth, $28 million from RevPAR growth, and $8 million from net favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower fees of $17 million from properties that converted from managed to franchised and $14 million from properties that were terminated. The $263 million increase in franchise fees primarily reflected $143 million of higher branding fees, driven by $138 million of higher fees from our co-brand credit card agreements, $82 million from unit growth, $21 million from RevPAR growth, $15 million from properties that converted from managed to franchised, and $6 million of higher relicensing and application fees, partially offset by lower fees of $9 million from properties that were terminated. The $42 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected net higher profits at managed hotels and $14 million from unit growth. In 2018, we earned incentive management fees from 72 percent of our managed properties worldwide versus 71 percent in 2017. We earned incentive management fees from 59 percent of managed properties in North America and 82 percent of managed properties outside North America in 2018, compared to 60 percent in North America and 80 percent outside North America in 2017. In addition, 63 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2018 came from our managed properties outside North America versus 62 percent in 2017. The $296 million increase in base management fees primarily reflected $273 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees, $18 million from stronger sales at Legacy-Marriott comparable properties primarily driven by RevPAR growth, and $14 million from Legacy-Marriott unit growth, partially offset by $6 million of lower fees from Legacy-Marriott properties that converted from managed to franchised and $4 million from Legacy-Marriott net unfavorable exchange rates. The $429 million increase in franchise fees primarily reflected $341 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees, $54 million from Legacy-Marriott unit growth, $18 million from Legacy-Marriott RevPAR growth, $14 million of higher Legacy-Marriott branding fees, and $7 million of higher fees from Legacy-Marriott properties that converted from managed to franchised. The $182 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected $159 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees and $22 million from higher net house profits at Legacy-Marriott managed hotels. The $10 million increase in contract investment amortization primarily reflected $5 million of higher contract write-offs related to terminated contracts at Legacy-Marriott hotels.

Accordingly, we intend to utilize the net proceeds for the benefit of our system of hotels and are currently developing those plans. Spending under those plans will be expensed in our Income Statements and reduce our profitability in future periods. The $449 million increase in franchise fees primarily reflected $346 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees, $54 million from Legacy-Marriott unit growth, $18 million from Legacy-Marriott RevPAR growth, $14 million of higher Legacy-Marriott branding fees, $11 million of higher Legacy-Marriott relicensing fees, and $7 million of higher fees from Legacy-Marriott properties that converted from managed to franchised. The $182 million increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected $159 million of higher Legacy-Starwood fees and $22 million from higher net house profits at Legacy-Marriott managed hotels. In 2017, we earned incentive management fees from 71 percent of our managed properties. In North America, we earned incentive management fees from 60 percent of our managed properties. Outside North America, we earned incentive management fees from 80 percent of our managed properties, representing 62 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2017 from managed properties. The $108 million increase in base management fees was driven by $103 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: the impact of stronger sales at existing properties ($22 million) and unit growth across our system ($15 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), lower deferred fee recognition ($11 million), and lower fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million). The $185 million increase in franchise fees was driven by $98 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: the impact of unit growth across our system ($48 million), higher branding fees ($39 million), stronger sales at existing properties ($16 million), and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($11 million), partially offset by lower relicensing fees ($22 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $106 million increase in incentive management fees was driven by $72 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott drivers: higher net house profit and unit growth, higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios ($10 million), and higher deferred fee recognition ($8 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). In 2016, 69 percent of our Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 68 percent in 2015. In North America, 65 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees in 2016 compared to 63 percent in 2015. Outside North America, 74 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees in both 2016 and 2015, representing 48 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2016 from Legacy-Marriott managed properties compared to 51 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2015. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses increased by $149 million, primarily due to $160 million of higher Legacy-Starwood owned and leased profits, partially offset by $7 million of net lower Legacy-Marriott owned and leased profits, primarily driven by lower RevPAR in Brazil and properties under renovation. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses increased by $104 million, driven by $78 million from the Starwood Combination and the following Legacy-Marriott changes: $17 million of net stronger performance at several properties following renovations, $15 million overall favorable results across our segments, and $4 million of lower pre-opening costs, partially offset by $10 million of lower profits from properties that converted from owned to managed.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2017-02-21.@We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 122 countries and territories under 30 brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We group our operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International. We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us.

We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use websites, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. On the Merger Date, we completed the Starwood Combination. Our Income Statements reflect a net loss of $39 million for Starwood’s results of operations for the period from September 23, 2016 to December 31, 2016, including merger-related costs and charges, net of tax, of $194 million. The combination of our brands creates a more comprehensive portfolio, enhances our global market distribution, and provides opportunities for cost efficiencies. Our combined company now operates or franchises over 6,000 properties with nearly 1.2 million rooms. See Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information. We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. Our RevPAR statistics for 2016, and for 2016 compared to 2015, include Legacy-Starwood comparable properties for both full years even though Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands before the Starwood Combination. Therefore, our RevPAR statistics include Legacy-Starwood properties for periods during which fees from the Legacy-Starwood properties are not included in our Income Statements. We provide these RevPAR statistics as an indicator of the performance of our brands and to allow for comparison to industry metrics, and they should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. Our RevPAR statistics for 2015, and for 2015 compared to 2014, are for Legacy-Marriott comparable properties only, as Marriott did not own the Legacy-Starwood brands at any time during that two-year period. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We define our comparable properties as our properties, including those that we acquired through the Starwood Combination, that were open and operating under one of our Legacy-Marriott or Legacy-Starwood brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2015 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. For 2016 compared to 2015, we had 3,698 comparable North American properties (including 483 Legacy-Starwood properties) and 965 comparable International properties (including 506 Legacy-Starwood properties). For 2015 compared to 2014, we had 3,077 comparable North American properties and 367 comparable International properties. We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Our 2016 results reflected a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system, favorable demand for our brands in many markets around the world, and slow but steady economic growth. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2016 increased 1.8 percent to $113.50, ADR increased 1.0 percent on a constant dollar basis to $156.53, and occupancy increased 0.6 percentage points to 72.5 percent, compared to 2015. In North America, 2016 lodging demand for our brands reflected increased transient business, driven by higher retail and government travel, but weaker premium-priced corporate transient demand. Group business was higher in most of 2016 compared to 2015. Revenue growth was constrained in certain markets by new lodging supply, weak demand from the oil and gas industries, the impact of the strong dollar on international travel to U.S. gateway markets, and moderate GDP growth. The 2017 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels in North America was up more than two percent as of year-end 2016, compared to the 2016 group pace measured as of year-end 2015. Our Europe region experienced higher demand in 2016 across most countries, led by Spain, Portugal and Russia, partially constrained by weaker demand in France, Belgium, and Turkey following terrorism events in those countries. In our Asia Pacific region in 2016, RevPAR growth was strong in India and Thailand, while RevPAR growth in China was constrained in Hong Kong and certain southern and tertiary China markets. Middle East demand continued to be impacted by geopolitical instability, oversupply in Dubai and Qatar, and lower oil prices. In South Africa, results were favorable in 2016, reflecting strong local demand and higher international tourism attracted by the weak South African Rand. In the Caribbean and Latin America, growth from strong demand in Mexico and the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was offset by concerns relating to the Zika Virus in the Caribbean and weak economic conditions in most markets in South America. We monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. Our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements. Compared to 2015, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2016 increased by 50 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room (“HP-PAR”) increased by 2.7 percent on a constant U.S. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls primarily at our Legacy-Marriott properties. North American company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 4.4 percent. International company-operated house profit margins increased by 20 basis points, and HP-PAR at those properties increased by 0.7 percent compared to 2015. In 2016, we added 348 properties with 55,321 rooms, in addition to the 1,342 properties and 381,440 rooms gained with the Starwood Combination on the Merger Date. Approximately 40 percent of the added rooms are located outside North America, and 18 percent are conversions from competitor brands. Of the rooms gained with the Starwood Combination, approximately 50 percent are located outside North America. In 2016, 34 properties (5,691 rooms) exited our system. At the end of 2016, including rooms under Legacy-Starwood brands, we had more than 420,000 hotel rooms in our development pipeline, which includes hotel rooms under construction and under signed contracts, and nearly 34,000 hotel rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. More than half of the rooms in our development pipeline are outside North America. We believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. Nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new Marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. These growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. See the “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” captions earlier in this report and the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” caption later in this report. The $48 million increase in franchise fees for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($48 million), stronger sales at existing properties ($16 million), and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($11 million), partially offset by lower relicensing fees ($22 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $34 million increase in incentive management fees for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected higher net house profit and unit growth, higher incentive fees earned from a few limited-service portfolios ($10 million), and higher deferred fee recognition ($8 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). In 2016, 69 percent of our Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 68 percent in 2015. In North America, 65 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in 2016 compared to 63 percent in 2015. Outside North America, 74 percent of Legacy-Marriott managed properties paid incentive fees in both 2016 and 2015, representing 48 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2016 from Legacy-Marriott managed properties compared to 51 percent of our total fees in 2015. The $25 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected $38 million of higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees, partially offset by $13 million of lower owned and leased revenue. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected lower revenues from properties that converted to managed ($60 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($15 million), partially offset by improved sales from several properties following renovations ($29 million), stronger sales at other existing properties across our segments ($28 million), and favorable results at two new owned properties ($9 million). Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our Loyalty Programs, reservations, and marketing programs. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $568 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue for Legacy-Marriott operations reflected the impact of higher property occupancies, unit growth across our system, and growth in the Marriott Rewards program membership and activity. The $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger RevPAR ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million). The $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher RevPAR and house profit margins primarily at company-managed North American properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. Higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the Delta Hotels acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation. In 2015, 68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014. Managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 represented 63 percent of properties in North America and 74 percent outside of North America, compared to 36 percent in North America and 73 percent outside of North America in 2014. The percentage of North American properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 primarily due to a few large North American Limited-Service portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014. In addition, in 2015, 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of North America versus 56 percent in 2014.cThe $36 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue reflected $44 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Protea Hotels in the 2014 second quarter. Lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from Protea Hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from The Miami Beach EDITION hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in Footnote 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions.”cThe $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. In 2015, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2016-02-18.@We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 87 countries and territories under 19 brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. We group our operations into three business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, and International. We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the Company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility. We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level (“above-property”). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. On November 15, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to combine with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”). The Merger Agreement provides for the Company to combine with Starwood in a series of transactions after which Starwood will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Starwood Combination”). If these transactions are completed, shareholders of Starwood will receive 0.920 shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and $2.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Starwood common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that they own immediately before these transactions. We expect that the combination will close in mid-2016, after customary conditions are satisfied, including shareholder approvals, required antitrust approvals, and the completion of Starwood’s previously announced spin-off of its vacation ownership business, or another spin-off, split-off, analogous disposition, or sale of its vacation ownership business. We believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. References to year-end 2015 RevPAR statistics throughout this report, including occupancy and ADR, reflect the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2014 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated: (1) 86% of North American properties (87% excluding Delta Hotels and Resorts) in 2015, 87% in 2014, and 89% in 2013; (2) 57% of International properties (68% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2015, 57% (71% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, and 75% in 2013; and (3) 82% of total properties (85% excluding Protea Hotels and Delta Hotels and Resorts) in 2015, 82% of total properties (85% excluding Protea Hotels) in 2014, and 87% in 2013. We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Our 2015 results reflected a favorable economic climate and demand for our brands in many markets around the world, reflecting generally low supply growth in the U.S. and Europe, moderate GDP growth in North America, improved pricing in most North American markets, and a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system. Comparable worldwide systemwide RevPAR for 2015 increased 5.2 percent to $112.25, average daily rates increased 4.1 percent on a constant dollar basis to $152.30, and occupancy increased 0.8 percentage points to 73.7 percent, compared to 2014. Generally strong U.S. group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2015, allowing us to eliminate discounts, shift business into higher rated price categories, and raise room rates. The growth was partially constrained by new select-service lodging supply and moderating GDP growth late in the year. In 2015, bookings for future group business in the U.S. improved. New group business booked in 2015 for any period in the future increased 9 percent year over year. The 2016 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels (Marriott, JW Marriott, Renaissance, The Ritz-Carlton, and Gaylord brands) in North America was up more than 6 percent as of year-end 2015, compared to the 2015 group booking pace measured as of year-end 2014. In North America, RevPAR from transient guests increased 5 percent in 2015 reflecting strong demand from professional services, technology, and defense firms moderated somewhat by weaker demand from manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and energy companies. The Europe region experienced higher demand in 2015 across most countries, primarily due to increased group and transient business driven by special events and the weak currency, partially constrained by weaker demand in France, particularly late in the year. Results improved in Russia due to increased domestic travel. In the Asia Pacific region, demand increased led by growth from corporate and other transient business in Japan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The growth was partially offset by weaker results in South Korea. RevPAR in Greater China moderated in 2015 due to the impact of supply growth in certain Southern China markets, continued austerity in Beijing, and lower inbound travel to Hong Kong, while demand in Shanghai remained strong. Middle East demand was weaker in 2015, reflecting the region’s instability and lower oil prices, partially offset by strong government and group demand in Saudi Arabia. Demand in the United Arab Emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in travelers from Russia. In Africa, results were favorable in 2015. In the Caribbean and Latin America, strong performance in the region in 2015 was driven by greater demand in Mexico and increased leisure travel to our Caribbean and Mexican resorts for most of the year, constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in Panama and weaker economies in Brazil and Puerto Rico. We monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. Our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2015, which allowed our hotels to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited ADR. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements. The $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger RevPAR ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million). The $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million). The $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher RevPAR and house profit margins primarily at company-managed North American properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. Higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the Delta Hotels and Resorts acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation. The $36 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue reflected $44 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $8 million in higher other revenue predominantly from branding fees and hotel service programs that we acquired as part of our acquisition of Protea Hotels in the 2014 second quarter. Lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from Protea Hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from The Miami Beach EDITION hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in Footnote No. 3, “Acquisitions and Dispositions.” Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our rewards programs, reservations, and marketing programs. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. Since the end of 2014, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system. The $51 million increase in total base management fees, largely reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across our system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million). The $79 million increase in total franchise fees, reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across our system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million). The $46 million increase in incentive management fees largely reflected higher net house profit at our North American and International managed hotels in addition to unit growth in International markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher North American Full-Service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million). We estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million. The $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various Protea Hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. Higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from Protea Hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased International properties, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five International properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013. The $764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across our system.

Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2014, of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide, we operated 41 percent under management agreements; our franchisees operated 56 percent under franchise agreements; and we owned or leased only two percent.

House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Revenues increased by $1,012 million (8 percent) to $13,796 million in 2014 from $12,784 million in 2013 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue ($764 million), higher franchise fees ($79 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue ($72 million), higher base management fees ($51 million), and higher incentive management fees ($46 million). We estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $11,055 million in 2014 from $10,291 million in 2013, reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across the system. The $51 million increase in total base management fees, to $672 million in 2014 from $621 million in 2013, largely reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million). The $79 million increase in total franchise fees, to $745 million in 2014 from $666 million in 2013, reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across the system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million). The $46 million increase in incentive management fees to $302 million in 2014 from $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher net house profit at our North American and International managed hotels in addition to unit growth in International markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher North American Full-Service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million). The $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $1,022 million in 2014 from $950 million in 2013 predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various Protea Hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. Higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from Protea Hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a North American Full-Service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased properties primarily from the International segment, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five International segment properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013. Revenues increased by $970 million (8 percent) to $12,784 million in 2013 from $11,814 million in 2012 as a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($886 million), higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), and higher incentive management fees ($24 million, comprised of a $27 million increase for North America and a $3 million decrease outside of North America), partially offset by lower owned, leased, and other revenue ($39 million). We estimate that the $970 million increase in revenues included $8 million of combined base management fee, franchise fee, and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $10,291 million in 2013 from $9,405 million in 2012, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system. The $40 million increase in total base management fees, to $621 million in 2013 from $581 million in 2012, mainly reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($18 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($18 million), primarily driven by Gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the additional four days of activity (approximately $3 million). The $59 million increase in total franchise fees, to $666 million in 2013 from $607 million in 2012, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($22 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($23 million), increased relicensing fees primarily for certain North American Limited-Service properties ($8 million), and the additional four days of activity (approximately $5 million). The $24 million increase in incentive management fees from $232 million in 2012 to $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher property-level income at managed hotels ($33 million), particularly full-service hotels in North America, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items: recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million) and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million). The $39 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $950 million in 2013 from $989 million in 2012, primarily reflected $35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and $28 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue. Lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer International segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in London, as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $118 million in 2013 and $106 million in 2012.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2014-02-20.@ We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 72 countries and territories under numerous brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2013, of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide, we operated 42 percent under management agreements; our franchisees operated 55 percent under franchise agreements; and we owned or leased only two percent. The remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties. We group our operations into four business segments: North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, and Luxury. We earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility. We remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level ("above-property"). Our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We address, through various means, hotels in the system that do not meet standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. In 2013, we successfully launched Mobile Check-In at 350 Marriott Hotels both in North America and select international locations. Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. We believe Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR"), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which both correlate with RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property’s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. References to year-end 2013 RevPAR statistics, including occupancy and average daily rate, throughout this report reflect the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. References to RevPAR statistics, including occupancy and average daily rate, have not been modified to a calendar basis for year-end 2012 compared to year-end 2011. Accordingly, these statistics reflect the 52-week period ended December 28, 2012 compared to the 52-week period ended December 30, 2011, with the exception of The Ritz-Carlton and Autograph Collection brand properties and properties located outside of the United States where statistics are for the twelve months ended for each year presented, consistent with historic presentation. For the properties located in countries that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the comparisons to the prior year period are on a constant U.S. dollar basis. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and have not, in either the current or previous periods presented, (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Comparable properties represented the following percentage of our properties for the years ended 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively: (1) 89%, 93%, and 94% of North American properties; (2) 75%, 78%, and 79% of International properties; and (3) 87%, 91%, and 92% of total properties. We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Conditions for our business continued to improve in 2013, reflecting generally low supply growth in the United States ("U.S."), global improving economic climate in many markets around the world, improved pricing in most markets, and a year-over-year increase in the number of properties in our system. Demand was particularly strong at luxury properties, followed by full-service properties, and limited-service properties. Comparable worldwide systemwide average daily rates for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 increased 3.4 percent on a constant dollar basis to $143.33, RevPAR increased 4.6 percent to $102.46, and occupancy increased 0.9 percentage points to 71.5 percent, compared to the same period a year ago. Continuing economic uncertainty in the U.S. and U.S. government sequestration had a dampening effect on short-term group customer demand through the 2013 first half. Short-term group customer demand improved in the 2013 second half, benefiting from better attendance at group functions. Group bookings in the 2013 second half for future short-term group business also improved. Government and government-related demand was constrained due to government spending restrictions and the U.S. federal government shutdown in October, particularly in Washington, D.C. and the surrounding areas. Transient demand was particularly strong in the western U.S., which allowed us to continue eliminating discounts, shifting business into higher rated price categories, and raising room rates. In the northeast U.S., weak group demand in the region in the first half of 2013, new supply in the city of New York, and weak government and government-related business in Washington, D.C., further impacted by the government shutdown, constrained RevPAR improvement. Leisure destinations in the U.S. had strong demand. The properties in our system serve both transient and group customers. Business transient and leisure transient demand in the U.S. was strong in 2013. For group business, two-thirds is typically booked before the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. Also, during an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. During the recent U.S. economic recession, organizers of large group meetings scheduled smaller and fewer meetings to take place in 2013 than was previously typical. As the U.S. economy recovered, we replaced this lower level of large advance-purchase groups with smaller, last-minute group bookings and transient business. Last-minute group demand weakened during the first half of 2013, largely driven by weak corporate business and soft government demand at many properties, but corporate demand improved in the 2013 second half. U.S. government group demand weakened further as the year progressed, significantly impacted by the government shutdown in the 2013 fourth quarter. Short-term group demand shortfalls in the 2013 first half were largely mitigated by strong transient demand leading to strong occupancy rates. At the same time, as transient guests typically spend less on food and beverage than group customers, property-level food and beverage revenues increased year-over-year more slowly than room revenue. In addition, spending on food and beverage in 2013 was constrained by the somewhat uncertain economic climate and government spending restrictions in the U.S. As of year-end 2013, our group revenue booking pace for company-operated Marriott Hotels brand properties in North America is up over 4 percent for stays in 2014, compared to year-end 2012 booking pace for stays in 2013, reflecting improved group demand and greater pricing power. Outside of North America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Northern United Kingdom had strong demand in 2013 while Western Europe experienced moderate RevPAR growth. London RevPAR declined in the first three quarters of 2013, reflecting tough comparisons to last year's summer Olympic Games, but improved in the 2013 fourth quarter. Demand in France weakened as the year progressed. Demand remained weak in European markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply and weak economies constrained RevPAR growth in a few markets. In the Middle East, demand was strong in the United Arab Emirates, but weakened further in Egypt (particularly in the second half of 2013), Jordan, and Qatar. Demand in the Asia Pacific region continued to moderate, as our hotels in China experienced weaker government-related travel, moderating economic growth, and new supply in several markets. Thailand and Indonesia had higher demand and strong RevPAR growth in 2013. We monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. We also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2013, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. For our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements. Revenues increased by $970 million (8 percent) to $12,784 million in 2013 from $11,814 million in 2012 as a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($886 million), higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), and higher incentive management fees ($24 million, comprised of a $27 million increase for North America and a $3 million decrease outside of North America), partially offset by lower owned, leased, and other revenue ($39 million). We estimate that the $970 million increase in revenues included $8 million of combined base management fee, franchise fee, and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. The $886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $10,291 million in 2013 from $9,405 million in 2012, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system. The $40 million increase in total base management fees, to $621 million in 2013 from $581 million in 2012, mainly reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($18 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($18 million), primarily driven by Gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the additional four days of activity (approximately $3 million). The $59 million increase in total franchise fees, to $666 million in 2013 from $607 million in 2012, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR due to increased demand ($22 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($23 million), increased relicensing fees primarily for certain North American Limited-Service properties ($8 million), and the additional four days of activity (approximately $5 million). The $24 million increase in incentive management fees from $232 million in 2012 to $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher property-level income at managed hotels ($33 million), particularly full-service hotels in North America, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items: recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million) and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million). The $39 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $950 million in 2013 from $989 million in 2012, primarily reflected $35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and $28 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue. Lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer International segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in London, as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $118 million in 2013 and $106 million in 2012. Revenues decreased by $503 million (4 percent) to $11,814 million in 2012 from $12,317 million in 2011. As detailed later in this report in the table under the caption "Former Timeshare Segment - 2012 Compared to 2011," the spin-off contributed to a net $1,282 million decrease in revenues. This decrease was partially offset by a $779 million increase in revenues in our lodging business. The $779 million increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($757 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million, comprised of an $18 million increase for North America and a $19 million increase outside of North America), and higher base management fees ($35 million), partially offset by lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($94 million, which includes a $70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section). The $562 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $9,405 million in 2012 from $8,843 million in 2011, reflected a $757 million increase (allocated across our lodging business) resulting from higher property-level demand and growth across our system, partially offset by a net $195 million decline in timeshare-related cost reimbursements due to the spin-off. The $21 million decrease in total base management fees, to $581 million in 2012 from $602 million in 2011, primarily reflected a decline of $56 million in former Timeshare segment ($51 million) and International segment ($5 million) base management fees due to the spin-off, partially offset by a net increase of $35 million across our lodging business. The $35 million net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($24 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($9 million), as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of $7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a North American-Limited Service joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and the unfavorable impact of $3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions. The $101 million increase in total franchise fees, to $607 million in 2012 from $506 million in 2011, primarily reflected an increase of $57 million in license fees from MVW and an increase of $44 million across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger RevPAR ($27 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($13 million). The $37 million increase in incentive management fees from $195 million in 2011 to $232 million in 2012 primarily reflected higher net property-level income ($30 million), new unit growth, net of terminations ($6 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million). The $94 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $989 million in 2012 from $1,083 million in 2011, primarily reflected $70 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay® corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter, $29 million of lower owned and leased revenue, and $3 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $7 million of higher branding fees and $3 million of higher other revenue. The $29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected: (1) $34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our International segment, primarily driven by three hotels that left the system ($18 million), weaker demand at three other hotels ($6 million), two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties ($5 million), and unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million); and (2) $23 million of lower revenue at a North American Full-Service segment property that converted from leased to managed at year-end 2011; partially offset by (3) $14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in London due to strong demand, in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games; and (4) $10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in Japan. The property in Japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $106 million in 2012 and $99 million in 2011.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2013-02-20.@We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 74 countries and territories under numerous brand names. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. At year-end 2012, we had 3,801 properties (660,394 rooms) in our system, including 35 home and condominium products (3,927 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. At year-end 2012, we grouped our operations into four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. We earn base management fees and in some cases incentive management fees from the hotels that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the hotels that others operate under franchise agreements with us. Base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. Net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less noncontrollable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like. We use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate either in conjunction with hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under our The Ritz-Carlton, EDITION, JW Marriott, Autograph Collection, and Marriott brand names. Third-party developers typically build and sell residences with little, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. At year-end 2012, we operated 43 percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 54 percent under franchise agreements, unconsolidated joint ventures that we have an interest in held management and provided services to franchised properties for 1 percent, and we owned or leased only 2 percent. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company.

In 2012, we introduced Marriott.jp, adding Japanese language capability to our online platforms. Together with Spanish, German, French, and Chinese, our guests now have a wider selection of languages with which to discover our properties online. Our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. We also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. We believe RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. We calculate constant dollar statistics by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Conditions for our lodging business continued to improve in 2012, reflecting generally low supply growth, a favorable economic climate in many markets around the world, the impact of operating efficiencies across our company, and a year-over-year increase in the number of hotels. Demand was strong in most North American markets, constrained somewhat in Washington, D.C. due to weak government demand associated with government spending restrictions and a shorter congressional calendar. The D.C. market also experienced the customarily lower demand levels in 2012 associated with an election year, although leisure and group business were strong in the summer months. In Europe, many economies continue to struggle although our properties there benefited from strong international arrivals. In addition, our hotels benefited from the Olympic Games in London, the Euro Cup Soccer Championship in Warsaw, and a strong fair calendar in Germany. Demand was weak in European markets more dependent on regional travel and new supply constrained RevPAR growth in a few European markets. Demand was strong in the United Arab Emirates and improved modestly but remained weak in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, and Oman. Demand in the Asia Pacific region continued to be strong particularly for properties in Thailand, China, and Indonesia. Demand in China in 2012 moderated somewhat as the year progressed, reflecting declines in government related travel ahead of the country's change in leadership, moderating economic growth, and new supply in several markets. RevPAR in India softened throughout 2012, reflecting the country's more challenging economic environment and increased supply. Compared to 2011, 2012 worldwide average daily rates increased 3.9 percent on a constant dollar basis to $137.49 for comparable systemwide properties, RevPAR increased 6.1 percent to $97.34, and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points to 70.8 percent. We monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual hotel demand levels, generally increasing room rates as demand increases. We also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2012, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. Our company-operated properties continuously monitor costs as we focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and actively pursue productivity improvements. The hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers. Overall, business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2012. Group demand improved in 2012, group customers spent more on their meetings, and group related property-level food and beverage volumes improved. Additionally, we saw an increase in short-term bookings for both large and small groups during 2012, and attendance at meetings frequently exceeded initial projections. Typically, two-thirds of group business is booked before the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. During an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. Group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off, and with improving group demand, is replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates. Projected group revenue for 2013 for comparable North American Marriott Hotels & Resorts properties is up six percent year-over-year, with more than half of the growth coming from rate. Negotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented nearly 15 percent of our full-service managed hotel room nights for 2012 in North America. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our business customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend in order to maximize property-level earnings. For 2013, we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business national-accounts clients in the first quarter. With approximately 85 percent of our negotiations complete, on average room rates for comparable customers are approximately five percent higher in 2013 than the prior year. On October 1, 2012, we acquired the Gaylord brand and hotel management company from Gaylord Entertainment Company (now called Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. ("Ryman Hospitality")) for $210 million. Ryman Hospitality continues to own the Gaylord hotels, which we manage under the Gaylord brand under long-term management agreements. This transaction added four hotels and approximately 7,800 rooms to our North American Full-Service segment, and included our entering into management agreements for several attractions at the Gaylord Opryland in Nashville, consisting of a showboat, a golf course, and a saloon. As part of the transaction, on December 1, 2012, we also assumed management of another hotel owned by Ryman Hospitality, the Inn at Opryland, with approximately 300 rooms. In 2012, we completed the sale of our ExecuStay® corporate housing business. Neither the sales price nor the gain we recognized was material to our results of operations and cash flows. The revenues, results of operations, assets, and liabilities of our ExecuStay business also were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented, and accordingly we have not reflected ExecuStay as a discontinued operation. In 2012, we completed the sale of our equity interest in a North American Limited-Service joint venture (formerly two joint ventures which were merged before the sale) and we amended certain provisions of the management agreements for the underlying hotel portfolio. As a result of this transaction, we received cash proceeds of $96 million, including $30 million of proceeds which is refundable over the term of the management agreements if the hotel portfolio does not meet certain quarterly hotel performance thresholds. To the extent the hotel portfolio meets the quarterly hotel performance thresholds, we will recognize the $30 million of proceeds over the remaining term of the management agreements as base fee revenue. In 2012, we recognized a gain of $41 million, which consisted of: (1) $20 million for the recognition of the gain we deferred in 2005 because we retained the equity interest following the original sale of land to one of the joint ventures and because there were contingencies associated with the 2005 transaction that expired with this sale; and (2) $21 million for the gain on the sale of the equity interest. We also recognized base management fee revenue totaling $7 million in 2012, primarily that we had deferred in earlier periods, but which we earned in conjunction with the sale. See Footnote No. 7, "Acquisitions and Dispositions" to our Financial Statements for more information on these lodging transactions. On November 21, 2011 ("the spin-off date"), we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary MVW. Under license agreements with us, MVW is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under The Ritz-Carlton brand. We now earn license fees under these agreements that we include in franchise fees. We do not allocate MVW license fees to any of our segments and instead include them in "other unallocated corporate." Because of our significant continuing involvement in MVW operations after the spin-off (by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and MVW), we continue to include the historical financial results before the spin-off of our former Timeshare segment in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Before the spin-off, we recorded a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after-tax) in our 2011 Income Statement under the "Timeshare strategy-impairment charges" caption. Please see Footnote No. 16, “Spin-off,” to our Financial Statements and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors; Other Risks” for more information on the spin-off and the impairment charges. Revenues decreased by $503 million (4 percent) to $11,814 million in 2012 from $12,317 million in 2011. As detailed in the preceding table, the spin-off contributed to a net $1,282 million decrease in revenues that was partially offset by a $779 million increase in revenues in our lodging business. The $779 million increase in revenues for our lodging business was a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($757 million), higher franchise fees ($44 million), higher incentive management fees ($37 million, comprised of an $18 million increase for North America and a $19 million increase outside of North America), and higher base management fees ($35 million), partially offset by lower owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($94 million, which includes a $70 million reduction from our sold corporate housing business as further discussed later in this section). The $562 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $9,405 million in 2012 from $8,843 million in 2011, reflected a $757 million increase (allocated across our lodging business) resulting from higher property-level demand and growth across our system, partially offset by a net $195 million decline in timeshare-related cost reimbursements due to the spin-off. The $21 million decrease in total base management fees, to $581 million in 2012 from $602 million in 2011, primarily reflected a decline of $56 million in former Timeshare segment ($51 million) and International segment ($5 million) base management fees due to the spin-off, partially offset by a net increase of $35 million across our lodging business. The $35 million net increase in base management fees across our lodging business primarily reflected stronger RevPAR ($24 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($9 million), as well as recognition in the 2012 third quarter of $7 million of previously deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a North American-Limited Service joint venture, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and the unfavorable impact of $3 million of fee reversals in 2012 for two properties to reflect contract revisions. The $101 million increase in total franchise fees, to $607 million in 2012 from $506 million in 2011, primarily reflected an increase of $57 million in license fees from MVW and an increase of $44 million across our lodging business primarily as a result of stronger RevPAR ($27 million) and the impact of unit growth across the system ($13 million). The $37 million increase in incentive management fees from $195 million in 2011 to $232 million in 2012 primarily reflected higher net property-level income ($30 million), new unit growth, net of terminations ($6 million), recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain International segment properties ($3 million), and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an International segment property's change in ownership ($3 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($4 million). In 2012, 33 percent of our managed properties paid us incentive management fees versus 29 percent in 2011. In addition, in 2012, 65 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the United States versus 67 percent in 2011. In North America, 14 North American Full-Service segment properties, seven North American Limited-Service segment properties, and two Luxury segment properties earned a combined $13 million in incentive management fees in 2012, but did not earn any incentive management fees in 2011. The $94 million decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $989 million in 2012 from $1,083 million in 2011, primarily reflected $70 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the ExecuStay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter, $29 million of lower owned and leased revenue, and $3 million of lower termination fees, partially offset by $7 million of higher branding fees and $3 million of higher other revenue. The $29 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected: (1) $34 million of lower revenue at several owned and leased properties in our International segment, primarily driven by three hotels that left the system ($18 million), weaker demand at three other hotels ($6 million), two hotels that are no longer leased but remain within our system as managed or franchised properties ($5 million), and unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million); and (2) $23 million of lower revenue at a North American Full-Service segment property that converted from leased to managed at year-end 2011; partially offset by (3) $14 million of higher revenue at one leased property in London due to strong demand, in part associated with the 2012 third quarter Olympic Games; and (4) $10 million of higher revenue at one leased property in Japan. The property in Japan benefited from favorable comparisons with 2011 as a result of very weak demand due to the earthquake and tsunami as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in 2012 from a utility company. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $106 million in 2012 and $99 million in 2011. Revenues increased by $626 million (5 percent) to $12,317 million in 2011 from $11,691 million in 2010, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($604 million); base management and franchise fees ($105 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($37 million); and incentive management fees ($13 million, all from properties outside of North America). These favorable variances were partially offset by lower Timeshare sales and services revenue ($133 million). The increases in base management fees, to $602 million in 2011 from $562 million in 2010, and in franchise fees, to $506 million in 2011 from $441 million in 2010, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, the impact of unit growth across our system and favorable foreign exchange rates. Base management fees in 2011 included $51 million for the timeshare business compared to $55 million in the prior year. Franchise fees in 2011 included $4 million for MVW license fees. The increase in incentive management fees from $182 million in 2010 to $195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and continued property-level cost controls and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,083 million in 2011, from $1,046 million in 2010, reflected $21 million of higher total branding fees, $7 million of higher corporate housing revenue, $4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue. Combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $99 million in 2011 and $78 million in 2010. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue, to $1,088 million in 2011 from $1,221 million in 2010, primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue reflecting the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily for sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income resulting from the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance before the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue, primarily reflecting the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue reflecting the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates before the spin-off date. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for more information on our former Timeshare segment. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,843 million in 2011 from $8,239 million in 2010, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2012-02-16.@Under numerous brand names in 73 countries and territories, we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels, corporate housing properties, and timeshare properties. We also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. At year-end 2011, our system was comprised of 3,718 properties (643,196 rooms). The figures in the preceding sentence include 32 home and condominium products (3,838 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,166 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. At year-end 2011, our operations are grouped into four business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, and Luxury Lodging. On November 21, 2011 ("the spin-off date"), we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation ("MVW"). In connection with the spin-off, we entered into several agreements with MVW, and, in some cases, certain of its subsidiaries, that govern our post-spin-off relationship with MVW, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement and two License Agreements for the use of Marriott and Ritz-Carlton marks and intellectual property. Under license agreements with us, MVW is both the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under The Ritz-Carlton brand. We receive license fees under these license agreements. Because of our significant continuing involvement in MVW future operations (by virtue of the license and other agreements between us and MVW), our former Timeshare segment's historical financial results prior to the spin-off date will continue to be included in our historical financial results as a component of continuing operations. Please see Footnote No. 17, “Spin-off,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements and “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors; Other Risks” for additional information. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also earn fees from credit card endorsements, the sale of branded residential real estate, and licensing the Marriott timeshare and fractional and Ritz-Carlton fractional brands to MVW. Prior to the spin-off of our Timeshare business, we also generated revenues from the following sources: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals, all of which we included in our Timeshare segment. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences). Residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Conditions for our lodging business improved in 2011 reflecting generally low supply growth, a more favorable economic climate in most developed markets around the world, albeit at a generally low growth rate, and stronger economic growth in emerging markets, strong unit growth, and the impact of operating efficiencies across our company. While economic growth in Europe slowed in the later part of 2011 and the level of economic growth is uncertain in the United States, we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control our costs. In 2011, as compared to 2010, worldwide average daily rates increased 3.4 percent on a constant dollar basis to $133.26 for comparable systemwide properties, with RevPAR increasing 6.4 percent to $92.69 and occupancy increasing 2.0 percentage points to 69.6 percent. For properties in North America in 2011, markets in the West reflected strong demand, while properties in the East and South reflected more moderate demand. In Washington, D.C., a shorter Congressional calendar and government spending concerns reduced lodging demand. For properties in China and Brazil, demand was particularly strong during 2011, while for properties in Europe, demand was more moderate reflecting the financial crisis and related economic concerns. Demand at properties in the Middle East remained weak reflecting continued unrest in that region, and demand outside of the more metropolitan regions in Britain remained weak as a result of government austerity measures. While demand in Japan was weak in the first quarter of 2011 reflecting the impact of the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, domestic demand began to improve in the 2011 second quarter and continued throughout the rest of 2011, but remained below 2010 levels. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010 and that improvement continued in 2011, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates. The hotels in our system serve both transient and group customers. Overall, business transient and leisure transient demand was strong in 2011, while group demand continues to improve. Group customers typically book rooms and meeting space with significant lead times, sometimes several years in advance of guest arrival. Typically, two-thirds of group business is booked prior to the year of arrival and one-third is booked in the year of arrival. During an economic recovery, group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings. Group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off, and with improving group demand, is being replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates. Negotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented 14 percent of our full-service hotel room nights for 2011 in North America. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. For 2012, we expect to complete negotiations with our special corporate business clients in the first quarter, and we expect rates to be higher than the prior year. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend. Properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property-level cost saving initiatives regarding menus and restaurant hours, room amenities, cross-training personnel, and utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible. We also control above-property costs, which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we continue to require (where legally permitted) or encourage employees to use their vacation time accrued during the year. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We also remove hotels from our system that no longer meet our standards. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We completed the roll out of our sales deployment strategy in 2011, which aligns our sales efforts around customer needs, reducing duplication of sales efforts, and enabling coverage for a larger number of accounts. We now have the systems, training, and incentives for sales associates to sell our represented hotels as a portfolio rather than solely on a hotel-by-hotel basis. Our largest properties continue to have sales staff assigned on property. In 2011, we also implemented innovative technology solutions, including our Retail Pricing Optimizer tool ("RPO") and our High Performance Pricing tool ("HPP"). RPO determines optimal transient retail (benchmark) rates for hotels using an analytically-driven and market-based methodology. We believe this technology provides a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increases efficiency in analysis and decision making, and produces increased property level revenue for transient retail and associated segments. HPP enables hotels to more effectively manage the rate set up and modification processes using web-based functionality. The streamlined process provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2011, we operated 44 percent of the hotel rooms in our worldwide system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, we owned or leased 2 percent, and 1 percent were operated or franchised through unconsolidated joint ventures. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we believe we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make. We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Constant dollar statistics are calculated by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. As noted previously, on November 21, 2011, we completed a spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary MVW. In preparing our former Timeshare segment to operate as an independent, publicly traded company following the spin-off of the stock of MVW management assessed the Timeshare segment's intended use of excess undeveloped land and built inventory and the current market conditions for those assets. On September 8, 2011, management approved a plan for our former Timeshare segment to accelerate cash flow through the monetization of certain excess undeveloped land and excess built luxury inventory. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $324 million ($234 million after-tax) in our 2011 Income Statement under the "Timeshare strategy-impairment charges" caption. We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption "Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges" later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section. Also see the "Timeshare" caption later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section, for additional information on the results of operations. Revenues increased by $626 million (5 percent) to $12,317 million in 2011 from $11,691 million in 2010, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($604 million); base management and franchise fees ($105 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($37 million); and incentive management fees ($13 million (all from properties outside of North America)). These favorable variances were partially offset by lower Timeshare sales and services revenue ($133 million). The increases in base management fees, to $602 million in 2011 from $562 million in 2010, and in franchise fees, to $506 million in 2011 from $441 million in 2010, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and, to a lesser extent, the impact of unit growth across the system and favorable foreign exchange rates. Base management fees in 2011 included $51 million associated with the timeshare business compared to $55 million in the prior year. Franchise fees in 2011 included $4 million associated with MVW license fees. The increase in incentive management fees from $182 million in 2010 to $195 million in 2011 primarily reflected higher net property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and continued property-level cost controls and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth in international markets and favorable foreign exchange rates. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,083 million in 2011, from $1,046 million in 2010, reflected $21 million of higher total branding fees, $7 million of higher corporate housing revenue, $4 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $3 million of higher other revenue. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $99 million and $78 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,088 million in 2011, from $1,221 million in 2010, primarily reflected: (1) $49 million of lower development revenue which reflected the spin-off and, to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable reportability primarily related to sales reserves recorded in 2010; (2) $45 million of lower financing revenue from lower interest income as a result of the transfer of the mortgage portfolio to MVW in conjunction with the spin-off as well as a lower mortgage portfolio balance prior to the spin-off date; (3) $32 million of lower other revenue, which primarily reflected the spin-off and lower resales revenue; and (4) $7 million of lower services revenue which reflected the spin-off, partially offset by increased rental occupancies and rates prior to the spin-off date. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our former Timeshare segment. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,843 million in 2011 from $8,239 million in 2010, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system. Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million). The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property-level costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2011-02-18.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,545 properties (618,104 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2010 and include 34 home and condominium products (3,391 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,043 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 70 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. During 2010 we broadened our timeshare interval product offering to include the sale of the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program in North America and the Caribbean. The Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program offers greater flexibility, further personalization and more experience opportunities for participating timeshare owners. See the “Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program” caption later in this Form 10-K for additional information. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences) and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Business conditions for our lodging business improved in 2010. While the recent recession significantly impacted lodging demand and hotel pricing, occupancies began to improve late in 2009 and that improvement continued throughout 2010. Room rates began to stabilize and improve in some markets in the 2010 second quarter, and that improvement continued, strengthened and expanded to other markets throughout the rest of 2010. In 2010, worldwide average daily rates on a constant dollar basis stayed the same as 2009 for company-operated properties. Worldwide RevPAR for company-operated properties increased 6.3 percent on a constant dollar basis for 2010, as compared to 2009, and occupancy increased 4.1 percentage points to 68.7 percent. While worldwide RevPAR for 2010 remained well below 2008 levels, we continued to see strengthening in properties in Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, and in our luxury properties around the world. Our hotels in Asia are particularly benefitting from strong economic growth in that region. Additionally, hotels in North America experienced stronger demand from corporate transient and association group customers in 2010 as compared to 2009, and that demand continued to strengthen progressively during the 2010 period. However, property-level banquet and catering spending continues to be weak primarily reflecting tight budgets and fewer group functions; although we did experience some improvement late in 2010. During the 2010 first quarter, group meeting cancellations declined to typical levels, and expected revenue from group meetings continued to improve throughout 2010. While our booking windows for both group business and transient business remain very short, our pace of bookings for group business for future periods continued to improve throughout 2010. We monitor market conditions continuously and carefully price our rooms daily to meet individual hotel demand levels. We modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. Demand for higher rated rooms improved in 2010, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business. This mix improvement benefited average daily rates at many hotels. Negotiated corporate business (“special corporate business”) represented 14 percent of our full-service hotel room nights for 2010 in North America. By late 2010, demand trends had further strengthened, and we had negotiated rates with more than two-thirds of our 2011 special corporate rate clients. Those rates were meaningfully higher than those we negotiated in 2009 and early 2010. We typically negotiate and fix room rates associated with special corporate business in advance of the year to which they apply, which limits our ability to raise these rates quickly. We expect to complete negotiations with our remaining special corporate business clients in the 2011 first quarter. In negotiating pricing for this segment of business, we do not focus strictly on volume, but instead carefully evaluate the relationship with our customers, including for example, stay patterns (day of week and season), locations of stays, non-room spend, and aggregate spend. Group business pricing is also inflexible in the near term, as some group business may be booked several years in advance of guest arrival. However, as a result of the recent recession, shorter group booking windows became more common for 2010 than they were in prior years. Accordingly, with strengthening demand, group business booked in 2010 showed stronger price improvement than business booked in 2009, and “in-the-year-for-the-year” bookings also increased in 2010. Properties in our system are maintaining very tight cost controls, as we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins. Where appropriate for market conditions, we have maintained many of our 2009 property-level cost saving initiatives such as adjusting menus and restaurant hours, modifying room amenities, cross-training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, and not filling some vacant positions. We also reduced above-property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have not filled certain above-property vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2010, we operated 45 percent of the hotel rooms in our system under management agreements, our franchisees operated 53 percent under franchise agreements, and we owned or leased 2 percent. Our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while the addition of new hotels to our system generates growth. This strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. In addition, we increase our financial flexibility by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we make. We consider RevPAR, which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period, to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. House profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. House profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable properties, systemwide RevPAR (which includes data from our franchised, managed, owned, and leased properties) increased by 4.9 percent in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels in most markets, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. For our properties outside North America, systemwide RevPAR for 2010 increased 9.2 percent versus 2009, reflecting improved occupancy levels, partially offset by a modest decline in average daily rates. We launched the points-based Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program (“MVCD Program”) in North America and the Caribbean in June 2010, and we are initially focusing our marketing efforts on existing customers. As a result, in 2010, contract sales to existing owners increased 31 percent while sales to new customers declined. We expect accelerated sales to new customers in 2011. See the “Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program” caption later in this Form 10-K for additional information. Contract sales for our timeshare, fractional, and residential products increased modestly in 2010, compared to 2009, largely due to a decline in contract sales cancellation allowances. We adjust our contract sales for cancellation allowances that we record in anticipation that a portion of contract revenue previously recorded for certain residential and fractional projects would not be realized due to pre-closing contract cancellations. At the same time, contract sales were constrained by difficult comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009. By the end of 2010, timeshare pricing improved because we had largely discontinued or reduced the purchase incentives and targeted marketing efforts instituted in 2009. Rental revenues increased in 2010 with stronger leisure demand for our Marriott Vacation Club product and greater available rental inventory. Demand for fractional and residential units remains weak. Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of contract sales continue to improve. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties continue to maintain very tight cost controls, and we have not filled certain vacant positions, and have required where legally permitted and elsewhere encouraged employees to use their vacation time accrued during 2010. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, current demand may not always be reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. On January 2, 2010, the first day of our 2010 fiscal year, we adopted the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards. As a result of adopting these standards in the 2010 first quarter, we consolidated 13 existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions, and we recorded a one-time non-cash after-tax reduction to shareholders’ equity of $146 million ($238 million pretax) in the 2010 first quarter, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Revenues increased by $783 million (7 percent) to $11,691 million in 2010 from $10,908 million in 2009, as a result of higher: cost reimbursements revenue ($557 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($98 million); base management and franchise fees ($73 million); incentive management fees ($28 million (comprised of a $12 million increase for North America and a $16 million increase outside of North America)); and owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($27 million). The increase in Timeshare sales and services revenue to $1,221 million in 2010, from $1,123 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher financing revenue due to higher interest income and to a lesser extent higher services revenue reflecting increased rental occupancy levels and rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower development revenue reflecting lower sales volumes primarily associated with tough comparisons driven by sales promotions begun in 2009, a $20 million increase in reserves (we now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on notes not in default), and lower sales to new customers in our initial launch of the MVCD Program. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The increases in base management fees, to $562 million in 2010 from $530 million in 2009, and in franchise fees, to $441 million in 2010 from $400 million in 2009, primarily reflected stronger RevPAR and the impact of unit growth across the system. The increase in incentive management fees, to $182 million in 2010 from $154 million in 2009, primarily reflected higher property-level revenue and continued tight property-level cost controls that improved 2010 margins compared to 2009 and, to a lesser extent, new unit growth. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,046 million in 2010, from $1,019 million in 2009, largely reflected $14 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees associated with six properties that exited our system, $8 million of higher branding fees, $6 million of higher revenue for owned and leased properties, and $5 million of higher other revenue. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a one-time $6 million transaction cancellation fee received in 2009. The increase in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected increased RevPAR and occupancy levels. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $78 million and $70 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income attributable to us. The increase in cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,239 million in 2010 from $7,682 million in 2009, reflected the impact of growth across the system, partially offset by lower property-level costs in response to cost controls. Net of hotels exiting the system, we added 4,287 managed rooms and 17,024 franchised rooms to our system in 2010. Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and services revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to 2008 and higher financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with our affinity credit card and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property-level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner. With particularly weak demand and low property-level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2010-02-12.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,420 properties (595,461 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2009 and include 30 home and condominium products (3,034 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,072 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under numerous separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. We also generate revenues from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals; and (4) rentals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (The Ritz-Carlton Residences), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. Weak economic conditions in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world, instability in the financial markets following the worldwide financial crisis that began in 2008, and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2009. Lodging demand in the United States, as well as internationally, remained soft throughout 2009, as a result of weak economic conditions, while hotel room supply increased in several markets. Demand for our luxury properties remained particularly weak. Outside the United States, concerns in the latter half of 2009 regarding the H1N1 virus also hurt demand, particularly in Mexico, as well as in some markets in Asia, the Caribbean and South America. We experienced continued weakness in 2009 associated with both group and business transient demand. New group meeting cancellations moderated progressively throughout 2009 as compared to the 2008 fourth quarter. New near-term group bookings remain soft, although they improved somewhat, particularly in the 2009 fourth quarter. While we continued to experience significant attrition rates in 2009 from expected attendance at meetings, that moderated somewhat in the latter half of 2009. Non-corporate demand, which remained weak in the 2009 first quarter, improved in the 2009 second quarter and even more so in the 2009 third and fourth quarters, largely as a result of significant promotional efforts and discounting aimed at replacing weak corporate business with leisure, government, and other discounted transient business. Through these challenging times, our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by driving revenue, increasing our market share and managing costs. Responding to the weak demand environment for hotel rooms, we continue to deploy a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase both property-level revenue and market share. We monitor market conditions continuously and are able to quickly institute high impact and low cost sales promotions as needed. These promotions are designed both to reward and retain loyal customers and to attract new guests. www.Marriott.com and our loyal Marriott Rewards member base are both low cost and high impact vehicles for our revenue generation efforts. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we also implemented sales associate, meeting planner, and customer incentives to close on new group business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and through our blog “Marriott on the Move.” We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. With a goal of continuing to improve the overall guest service experience, we improved www.Marriott.com in 2009 by redesigning the website to significantly enhance its functionality and modernize its appearance. Properties in our system instituted and are maintaining very tight cost controls. Given the current weak demand environment, we continue to work aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property-level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, relaxing some brand standards for hotels, cross-training personnel, utilizing personnel at multiple properties where feasible, eliminating certain positions, and not filling some vacant positions. We have also reduced above-property costs, which are allocated to hotels, by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas. In addition, we have eliminated or not filled certain above-property positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2009, 46 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 52 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long-term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, we maintain financial flexibility by minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars, unless otherwise noted. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. For our North American comparable company-operated properties, RevPAR decreased by 18.5 percent in 2009, compared to 2008, reflecting weakness in most markets. Our 2009 fiscal year began on January 3, 2009, and included 52 weeks while the prior year included 53 weeks and two New Year’s holidays. If RevPAR for 2008 was calculated for the 52 week period ended January 2, 2009, RevPAR would have declined by an average of 19.3 percent for our North American comparable company-operated properties. For our comparable managed properties outside North America, RevPAR for 2009 decreased 18.0 percent versus 2008, with weakness in most markets around the world. Compared to 2008, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins for 2009 decreased by 380 basis points reflecting the impact of RevPAR declines from weak demand, partially offset by strong cost control plans in 2009 at properties in our system. Weak economic conditions, instability in the financial markets, and low consumer confidence also kept demand for timeshare intervals soft in 2009. Demand for fractional and residential units was particularly weak. As a result, we slowed or canceled some development projects and closed less efficient timeshare sales offices in 2008 and 2009. We also increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives and eliminated or did not fill certain positions in 2008 and 2009. During the 2009 second and third quarters, we were able to increase sales over the 2009 first quarter through various sales promotions, including pricing adjustments. As with Lodging, our Timeshare properties have instituted very tight cost controls, and we have eliminated or not filled certain positions, and have encouraged, or, where legally permitted, required employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. For additional information on our company-wide restructuring efforts, see our “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” caption later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segment’s businesses continued to experience, we evaluated our entire Timeshare segment portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September 22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. These decisions resulted in our recording 2009 third quarter pretax charges totaling $752 million ($502 million after-tax). We discuss these charges in more detail under the caption “Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, soft demand frequently is not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also reduce nearer-term Timeshare segment results as percentage-of-completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use website, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary website, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We have added other languages to www.Marriott.com, and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. Revenues decreased by $1,971 million (15 percent) to $10,908 million in 2009 from $12,879 million in 2008, as a result of lower: cost reimbursements revenue ($1,152 million); Timeshare sales and service revenue ($300 million); owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue ($206 million); incentive management fees ($157 million (comprised of $108 million for North America and $49 million outside of North America)); base management fees ($105 million (comprised of $79 million for North America and $26 million outside of North America)); and franchise fees ($51 million). The decrease in cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,682 million in 2009 from $8,834 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level costs, in response to lower occupancy and cost controls, partially offset by the impact of growth across the system. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. We added 35 managed properties (8,574 rooms) and 200 franchised properties (25,136 rooms) to our system in 2009, net of properties exiting the system. The decrease in Timeshare sales and services revenue of $300 million (21 percent), to $1,123 million in 2009, from $1,423 million in 2008, primarily reflected lower demand for timeshare intervals and to a lesser extent, residential products and the Asia Pacific points program, as well as lower revenue from projects with limited available inventory in 2009, and lower reacquired and resales revenue and services revenue. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from projects that became reportable subsequent to the 2008 fiscal year and higher financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue, to $1,019 million in 2009, from $1,225 million in 2008, largely reflected $183 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $19 million of lower revenue associated with our corporate housing business, $14 million of lower hotel agreement termination fees, and $5 million of lower branding fees associated with the sale of residential real estate, partially offset by $11 million of increased branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and a $3 million favorable impact related to a property that was being renovated during 2008, and as a result was not operating at full capacity. Combined branding fees associated with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate totaled $70 million and $64 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected RevPAR declines associated with weak lodging demand. The decrease in incentive management fees, to $154 million in 2009 from $311 million in 2008, reflected lower property-level revenue, associated with weak demand, lower RevPAR, and the associated lower property-level operating income and margins in 2009 compared to 2008. Most incentive management fees are earned only after each hotel earns a minimum return for the hotel’s owner. With particularly weak demand and low property-level operating income in 2009, most managed hotels did not have sufficient operating income to allow us to earn an incentive fee. In 2009, only 25 percent of managed hotels paid incentive fees to us, as compared to 56 percent in 2008. The decreases in base management fees, to $530 million in 2009 from $635 million in 2008, and franchise fees, to $400 million in 2009 from $451 million in 2008, both reflected RevPAR declines driven by weaker demand, partially offset by the favorable impact of unit growth across the system. Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property-level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the “BUSINESS SEGMENTS” discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2009-02-12.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 3,178 properties (560,681 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2008 and include 27 home and condominium projects (2,482 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,332 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 18 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate either in conjunction with luxury hotel development or on a stand-alone basis under The Ritz-Carlton brand (Ritz-Carlton-Residential), and in conjunction with Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Other residences are typically constructed and sold by third-party developers with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive. The economic recession, the global credit crisis and eroded consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business environment in 2008. U.S. lodging demand declined throughout 2008, but especially in the fourth quarter, as a result of slowing economic growth. Outside the United States, international lodging demand was generally stronger in most markets than in the United States, but also softened progressively throughout 2008 and declined markedly in the 2008 fourth quarter. Leisure transient demand in the United States weakened in the first quarter of 2008 and was joined by weakening business transient demand beginning in the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, demand associated with our luxury properties decreased dramatically in the 2008 fourth quarter. These factors were compounded in several markets in the United States where the supply of hotel rooms increased. Last minute new group meeting demand and attendance at group meetings softened considerably throughout 2008 as well, and group meeting cancellations increased significantly in the fourth quarter. While some business customers increased room nights in 2008, including professional services firms, defense contractors, and insurance companies, others declined, including companies associated with the financial services, automotive, and telecommunications industries. In general, for the properties in our system, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand worldwide than our limited-service and luxury properties. U.S. demand for timeshare intervals also softened considerably in 2008, and especially in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak consumer confidence and a very difficult financing environment, while demand in Latin America and Asia for timeshare products was stronger compared to 2007. Demand for Ritz-Carlton fractional and residential units was particularly weak. Since the sale of timeshare and fractional intervals and condominiums follows the percentage-of-completion accounting method, soft demand is frequently not reflected in our Timeshare segment results until later accounting periods. Intentional and unintentional construction delays could also unfavorably impact nearer-term Timeshare segment results as percentage-of-completion revenue recognition may correspondingly be delayed as well. Responding to the challenging demand environment in 2008 for hotel rooms, we initiated a range of new sales promotions with a focus on leisure and group business opportunities to increase property-level revenue. These promotions were designed to keep current customers loyal while also attracting new guests. In response to increased hesitancy to finalize group bookings, we have also implemented sales associate and customer incentives to close on business. As more customers use social media, we have also found new ways to connect, communicating with more than 300,000 of our customers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and through our blog “Marriott on the Move.” We also continue to enhance our Marriott Rewards loyalty program offerings and specifically market to this large and growing customer base. Given this slower demand environment, we worked aggressively to reduce costs and enhance property-level house profit margins by modifying menus and restaurant hours, reviewing and adjusting room amenities, and not filling some vacant positions. While varying by property, most properties in our system have instituted contingency plans with very tight cost controls. We have also reduced the above-property costs by scaling back systems, processing, and support areas that are allocated to the hotels. We have also eliminated certain positions, not filled some vacant positions, and will encourage, and where legally permitted, require employees to use their vacation time accrued during the 2009 fiscal year. Additionally, we canceled certain hotel development projects. For our Timeshare segment, we have slowed or canceled some development projects, closed less efficient timeshare sales offices and increased marketing efforts and purchase incentives. For additional information on our companywide restructuring efforts, see our “Restructuring Costs and Other Charges” caption later in this section. Our lodging business model involves managing and franchising hotels, rather than owning them. At year-end 2008, 48 percent of the hotel rooms in our system were operated under management agreements, 50 percent were operated under franchise agreements, and 2 percent were owned or leased by us. Our emphasis on property management and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness while continued unit expansion, reflecting properties added to our system, generates ongoing growth. With long-term management and franchise agreements, this strategy has allowed substantial growth while reducing leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. Additionally, by reducing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling those investments we do make, we increase our financial flexibility. We calculate RevPAR by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available to guests for the period. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. References to RevPAR throughout this report are in constant dollars unless otherwise noted. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR decreased in 2008, compared to the year-ago period, with moderately greater strength in Manhattan, New York, Houston, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, California and weaker RevPAR in suburban markets near, among other areas, Orange County, California, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. Outside North America, 2008 RevPAR increases versus the prior year period were stronger, particularly in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, South America, and Central Europe. Company-operated house profit margin is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue. We consider house profit margin to be a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. Gross operating profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. Gross operating profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses. Compared to 2007, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins for 2008 decreased by 70 basis points reflecting the impact of stronger year-over-year RevPAR associated with international properties and very strong cost control plans in 2008 at properties in our system. This impact was more than offset by the impact of RevPAR declines year-over-year associated with properties in North America reflecting weaker demand and higher expenses in 2008 in North America primarily due to increased utilities and payroll costs. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest December 31 and while the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years included 52 weeks, the 2008 fiscal year included 53 weeks. As the 53rd week for 2008 included the New Year’s holiday and was seasonally slow, it had the effect of reducing year-over-year RevPAR performance. While worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company-operated properties decreased 1.1 percent compared to 2007, worldwide comparable RevPAR for 2008 for company-operated properties excluding the extra 53rd week decreased 0.4 percent compared to 2007. Our brands remain strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multichannel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. We have added other languages to Marriott.com and we have enabled guests to use handheld devices to make and confirm reservations and get directions. Revenues decreased by $111 million (1 percent) to $12,879 million in 2008 from $12,990 million in 2007, primarily as a result of lower Timeshare sales and service revenue and lower incentive management fees, partially offset by the impact of unit growth across the system. Base management and franchise fees increased by $27 million as a result of improved RevPAR in international markets and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of declines in North American RevPAR. The $27 million increase in combined base management and franchise fees also reflected the impact of both base management fees totaling $6 million in 2007 from business interruption insurance proceeds and $13 million of lower franchise relicensing fees in 2008. Incentive management fees decreased by $58 million primarily reflecting the recognition in the 2007 period of: (1) incentive management fees totaling $17 million that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2007; and (2) $13 million of incentive management fees from business interruption proceeds associated with Hurricane Katrina. The decrease in incentive management fees also reflected lower property-level profitability due to lower occupancy and higher property-level wages and benefits costs and utilities costs, particularly in North America. Partially offsetting the decreases, incentive management fees from international properties increased, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. See the “BUSINESS SEGMENTS” discussion later in this report for additional information. The $15 million (1 percent) decrease in owned, leased, corporate housing, and other revenue largely reflected $10 million of lower revenue for owned and leased properties, $17 million of lower revenue associated with a services contract that terminated at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and the receipt in 2008 of $15 million in hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees, compared to $19 million in 2007 and flat branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in both 2008 and 2007), partially offset by $17 million of higher corporate housing revenue. The $10 million decrease in owned and leased revenue primarily reflected the conversion of owned hotels to managed hotels. Timeshare sales and services revenue in 2008 decreased by $324 million (19 percent) compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected lower demand in 2008, revenue recognition of contract sales for several projects in 2007 that reached reportability thresholds, and lower revenue from several projects with limited available inventory in 2008, as well as a decrease of $65 million in note sale gains in 2008 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases in revenue in 2008 compared to the prior year was higher revenue associated with the Asia Pacific points program, increased interest income, revenue associated with projects that became reportable subsequent to 2007, and increased services revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. The $111 million decrease in total revenue includes $259 million (3 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue to $8,834 million in 2008 from $8,575 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to sales growth and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added six managed properties (3,100 rooms) and 157 franchised properties (19,836 rooms) to our system in 2008, net of properties exiting the system. Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. See “BUSINESS SEGMENTS: Timeshare,” later in this report for additional information on our Timeshare segment. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent). The increase largely reflected stronger RevPAR and the mix of owned and leased properties in 2007, compared to 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher branding fees associated with both affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate (totaling $64 million in 2007 and $52 million in 2006), offset by the recognition of $19 million of hotel management and franchise agreement termination fees in 2007, compared to the recognition of $26 million of such fees in 2006. The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million (6 percent) of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to wage increases, sales growth, and the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 15 managed properties (4,870 rooms) and 138 franchised properties (15,963 rooms) to our system in 2007, net of properties exiting the system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2008-02-15.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,999 properties (535,093 rooms) and related facilities. The figures in the preceding sentence are as of year-end 2007 and include 21 home and condominium projects (1,916 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations. In addition, we provided 2,156 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. Our operations are grouped into five business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, and Timeshare. We operate, develop, and franchise under 19 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We earn base, incentive, and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties; (2) operating the resorts and residential properties; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. We earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own or lease. Finally, we earn fees in association with affinity card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate. We sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Club-Residential and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential). Our Timeshare segment residential projects are typically opened over time with limited inventory available at any one time. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential products distinctive. Generally, lodging demand remained strong through 2007, driven by continued strength associated with worldwide business travel. In general, luxury, international, and full-service properties experienced stronger demand than limited-service properties. Strong demand enabled us to increase rates at the property level, which resulted in solid year-over-year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year-over-year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in many markets around the world. For our North American comparable properties, RevPAR increases in 2007, as compared to the year-ago period, were particularly strong in Dallas, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Internationally, 2007 RevPAR increases as compared to the prior year were particularly strong in Central and South East Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Our approach to improving property-level and above-property productivity has benefited our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees. Driving room rate improvement, benchmarking successful performance, and leveraging our size have all contributed to property-level margin improvements and higher incentive management fees to us. We continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary Web site, www.Marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we continue to capture an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multi-channel central reservations system, and desirable property amenities. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. In 2007, we announced our agreement with the Nickelodeon division of Viacom, Inc. and Miller Global Properties, LLC to co-develop a new lodging resort brand and concept for travelers seeking fun and adventure, “Nickelodeon Resorts by Marriott.” Also during 2007, we announced our agreement with Ian Schrager to create a global boutique lifestyle hotel brand “Edition” on a large scale. Revenues increased by $995 million (8 percent) to $12,990 million in 2007 from $11,995 million in 2006, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, which allowed us to increase room rates and favorable exchange rates worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $116 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth, as we opened 203 properties (29,200 rooms) throughout 2007. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006, versus no similar fees in 2007. Incentive management fees increased by $88 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees included $17 million and $10 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Furthermore, incentive management fees for 2007 included $13 million and base management fees for 2007 included $6 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with hurricanes in prior years compared to $1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $170 million (11 percent) in 2007 over the prior year. The increase largely reflected development revenue increases over the prior year as some newer projects reached revenue recognition thresholds. In 2006, some projects were in the early stages of development and did not reach revenue recognition thresholds until 2007. The increase in revenue also reflects increased services and financing revenue. Owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue increased by $121 million (11 percent).

The $995 million increase in total revenue includes $500 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,575 million in 2007 from $8,075 million in the prior year.

Revenues increased by $866 million (8 percent) to $11,995 million in 2006 from $11,129 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Base management and franchise fees increased by $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior periods’ results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees increased by $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements. Incentive management fees include $10 million and $14 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, that were calculated based on prior periods’ earnings but not earned and due until the periods in which they were recognized. Stronger catering, food and beverage, spa, and other profits also drove property-level margins higher. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases. Owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of our purchase, early in the second half of 2005, of 13 formerly managed properties from CTF Holdings Ltd. (“CTF”). See Footnote No. 8, “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” later in this report for a detailed description of the CTF transaction. As planned, eight of the CTF properties were sold during 2006: one property was sold in the first quarter; five properties were sold in the second quarter; and two properties were sold in the third quarter. Timeshare sales and services revenue increased by $90 million (6 percent) over the prior year. The increase largely reflects $77 million of revenue in 2006 from note securitization gains. As detailed later in the “Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle” narrative, note securitization gains of $69 million for 2005 are not reflected in revenue, but instead are a component of gains and other income. Additionally, financing and services revenue increased in 2006 versus the prior year, as did villa rental revenue. Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell-out. The $866 million increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms) and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms) to our system in 2006, net of properties exiting the system.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2007-02-21.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,832 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into six business segments: North American Full-Service Lodging, North American Limited-Service Lodging, International Lodging, Luxury Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 68 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our Timeshare segment: (1) selling timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership properties; (2) operating the resorts; and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. Generally, lodging demand remained robust through 2006, driven by continued strength associated with business and leisure travelers, while lodging supply growth continued to remain low. At the property level, these factors enabled us to increase rates and improve revenue mix, which resulted in strong year-over-year RevPAR increases. Revenue mix improvement is a function of the strong demand environment and results as some less profitable business is limited in favor of more profitable business, such as fewer discounted leisure packages in favor of more corporate business. This deliberate strategy of shifting business to higher rated tiers, yielded strong year-over-year average daily rate growth and only modest occupancy declines. Rates have also increased as stronger demand enabled us to reduce available discounts and special rates. In addition, group rates continue to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. Demand for our brands is strong in most markets around the world, and the weak U.S. dollar continues to drive international travelers into the United States. For our North American properties, RevPAR increases in 2006 as compared to the year ago period were particularly strong in New York, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle. Across the U.S., demand also strengthened in many smaller city and suburban markets during 2006. Internationally, RevPAR increases in 2006 versus the prior year were particularly strong in China, Mexico, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Our brands are strong as a result of superior customer service with an emphasis on guest satisfaction, the worldwide presence and quality of our brands, our Marriott Rewards loyalty program, an information-rich and easy-to-use Web site, a multi-channel central reservations system and desired property amenities including meeting and banquet facilities, fitness centers, spas, award-winning restaurants and high-speed and wireless Internet access. We, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of both new and renovated properties, new room and public space designs, enhanced amenities and technology offerings. Revenues increased 5 percent to $12,160 million in 2006 from $11,550 million in 2005, as a result of stronger demand for hotel rooms worldwide, partially offset by a decline in revenue associated with our synthetic fuel operation. Base management and franchise fees increased $117 million as a result of stronger RevPAR and unit growth. In 2006, we recognized $5 million of base management fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2006. Incentive management fees improved $80 million due to stronger RevPAR and property-level margin improvements associated with room rate increases and productivity improvements.

Partially offsetting these increases, development revenue declined due to projects in the early stages of development that did not reach revenue recognition thresholds and limited available inventory associated with projects that sold out or were nearing sell-out. As compared to 2005, synthetic fuel revenue was significantly lower in 2006, primarily due to the suspensions of production in 2006 as a result of high oil prices. Synthetic fuel production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2006. The 5 percent increase in total revenue includes $404 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $8,075 million in 2006 from $7,671 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark-up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and to wage increases. We added 13 managed properties (4,126 rooms), net, and 77 franchised properties (11,286 rooms), net, to our system in 2006. Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed CTF properties. The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage and wage increases. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms), net, to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section), and we also added 49 franchised properties (6,333 rooms), net, to our system in 2005. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67,” and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and FAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction in revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The initial adoption of SOP 04-2 in our 2006 first quarter, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our Consolidated Statement of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $105 million ($0.24 per diluted share). As a result of tax rate adjustments in the 2006 fourth quarter, we reduced the tax benefit associated with the initial adoption from $68 million to $64 million. Accordingly, the after-tax impact of the adoption was $109 million ($0.25 per diluted share). As a result of the change, “Net Income” of $65 million ($0.15 per diluted share) as reported in the 2006 first quarter, now totals $61 million ($0.14 per diluted share). The pre-tax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities of $18 million. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are a member, and the Staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had communications regarding SOP 04-2 and the income statement presentation of timeshare note securitizations gains. As a result of those communications, we reclassified in our 2006 third quarter, in our Consolidated Statement of Income, Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $40 million recognized in the 2006 second quarter from the “Gains and other income” caption to the “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption. As a result of the change, “Timeshare sales and services” revenue of $331 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $371 million, and “Gains and other income” of $48 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $8 million. Including $37 million of Timeshare segment note securitization gains recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter, full-year 2006 note securitization gains totaling $77 million are reflected within our “Timeshare sales and services” revenue caption.

In addition, we earn revenues from the limited number of hotels we own and lease and we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments. Similar to conditions that existed last year, lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2005, while demand growth was high. As a result, both occupancies and average daily rates continued to rise. Transient demand, both business and leisure, was strong in 2005, and we experienced particularly robust pricing power associated with that demand. In addition, our group rates are continuing to increase as business negotiated in earlier years at lower rates is being replaced with business negotiated at higher rates. In the United States, demand was strongest in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand was also strong in Hawaii. The weak U.S. dollar, in relation to other currencies, helped increase travel, versus the prior year, into the United States. In addition, we saw increased demand associated with U.S. vacationers who were also impacted by the weak U.S. dollar and traveled domestically instead of abroad. Outside of the United States we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in China, Hong Kong, the Middle East, Mexico and the Caribbean. Demand in Europe and South American countries continues to remain less robust, as some economies continue to emerge from a slowdown. Revenues increased 14 percent to $11,550 million in 2005 from $10,099 million in 2004, as a result of strong demand for hotel rooms worldwide. Year-over-year RevPAR increases were driven primarily by rate increases and to a lesser extent by occupancy improvement. The increase in revenue versus the prior year also reflects recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. Higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue also improved our 2005 revenues. In addition, revenues increased due to the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter which resulted in the recognition of revenue for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. Further, owned and leased revenue increased significantly, primarily as a result of the purchase of 13 formerly managed properties (see the “CTF Holdings Ltd.” discussion later in this report under the “Acquisitions” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section). The 14 percent increase in total revenue includes $743 million of increased cost reimbursements revenue, to $7,671 million in 2005 from $6,928 million in the prior year. This revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. As we record cost reimbursements based upon the costs incurred with no added mark-up, this revenue and related expense have no impact on either our operating income or net income. The increase in reimbursed costs is primarily attributable to the growth in the number of properties we manage. We added 45 managed properties (4,519 rooms) to our system in 2005 (including the Whitbread properties more fully discussed later in this report under the caption “Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section). Revenues increased 12 percent to $10,099 million in 2004 from $9,014 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher fees related to increased demand for hotel rooms and unit expansion, as well as higher timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue. Operating income increased $78 million to $555 million in 2005 from $477 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the following items: a combined base, incentive and franchise fee improvement of $154 million reflecting a stronger demand environment; $51 million of stronger timeshare interval, fractional, and whole ownership sales and services revenue net of direct expenses reflecting higher financially reportable development revenue; and $65 million of stronger owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses. The fee improvement versus the prior year also reflects the recognition in 2005 of $14 million of incentive fees that were calculated based on prior period results, but not earned and due until 2005. The increase in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue net of direct expenses is primarily attributable to properties acquired in 2005, including the CTF properties, the strong demand environment in 2005, and our receipt in 2005, of a $10 million termination fee associated with one property that left our system. The favorable items noted above were partially offset by $146 million of increased general and administrative expenses and $46 million of lower synthetic fuel revenue net of synthetic fuel expenses. Increased general and administrative expenses were associated with our Lodging segments as unallocated general and administrative expenses were down slightly compared to the prior year. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses reflects a $94 million pre-tax charge impacting our Full-Service Lodging segment, primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of management agreements (discussed more fully later in this report in the “CTF Holdings Ltd.” discussion under the “Investing Activities Cash Flows” caption in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section), and $30 million of pre-tax expenses associated with our bedding incentive program, impacting our Full-Service, Select-Service and Extended-Stay Lodging segments. We implemented the bedding incentive program in 2005 to ensure that guests could enjoy the comfort and luxury of our new bedding by year-end 2005. General and administrative expenses in 2005 also reflect pre-tax performance termination cure payments of $15 million associated with two properties, a $9 million pre-tax charge associated with three guarantees, increased other net overhead costs of $13 million including costs related to the Company’s unit growth, development and systems, and $2 million of increased foreign exchange losses partially offset by $5 million of lower litigation expenses. Additionally, in 2004, general and administrative expenses included a $13 million charge associated with the write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs. Operating income for 2005 includes a synthetic fuel operating loss of $144 million versus $98 million of operating losses in the prior year, reflecting increased costs and the consolidation of our synthetic fuel operations from the start of the 2004 second quarter, which resulted in the recognition of revenue and expenses for all of 2005 versus only three quarters in 2004, as we accounted for the synthetic fuel operations using the equity method of accounting in the 2004 first quarter. For additional information, see our “Synthetic Fuel” segment discussion later in this report. Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004 from $377 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger RevPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million from $523 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in our Full-Service, Select-Service, and Extended-Stay segments ($55 million) and Timeshare segment ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to the Company’s unit growth and timeshare development, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. Higher general and administrative expenses of $84 million also reflect a $13 million write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs as further discussed in the “2004 Compared to 2003” caption under the “Select-Service Lodging” heading later in this report.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2005-02-23.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,632 hotels and related facilities. Our operations are grouped into five business segments, Full-Service Lodging, Select-Service Lodging, Extended-Stay Lodging, Timeshare and Synthetic Fuel. In our Lodging business, we operate, develop and franchise under 13 separate brand names in 66 countries and territories. We also operate and develop Marriott timeshare properties under four separate brand names. We earn base, incentive and franchise fees based upon the terms of our management and franchise agreements. Revenues are also generated from the following sources associated with our timeshare business: (1) selling timeshare intervals, (2) operating the resorts, and (3) financing customer purchases of timesharing intervals. In addition, we earn revenues and generate tax credits from our synthetic fuel joint ventures. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense and interest income. With the exception of our Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes to our segments. As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. Lodging supply growth in the United States was low during 2004, while demand growth was high. In the United States, demand was strong in the Eastern and Western regions, while the Midwestern and South Central regions experienced more moderate increases in demand. Demand associated with business travel improved steadily in 2004, and leisure demand remained high. The weak U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies, particularly the euro, resulted in increased travel into the U.S. as overseas trips for many international travelers were less expensive. Conversely, many U.S. vacationers who might have traveled abroad, traveled domestically instead, as the weak dollar made overseas trips more costly. Outside of the U.S. we experienced stronger demand versus the prior year, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. While demand in Latin America and the Caribbean was also good, Europe remains a challenge, as some economies have been slow to rebound. We focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy.” Our Look No Further Best Rate Guarantee, strong Marriott Rewards loyalty program, and information-rich, easy to use web site encourage customers to make reservations through Marriott.com. We have complete control over our inventory and pricing and utilize online agents on an as needed basis. The shift of hotel bookings to our web site from other online channels results in higher revenue, margins and profitability. Operating income increased $100 million to $477 million in 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher fees, which are related both to stronger REVPAR, driven by increased occupancy and average daily rate, and to the growth in the number of rooms, and strong timeshare results, which are mainly attributable to strong demand and improved margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $84 million in 2004 to $607 million, primarily reflecting higher administrative expenses in both our lodging ($55 million) and timeshare businesses ($24 million), primarily associated with increased overhead costs related to the Company’s unit growth and increased development costs primarily associated with our Timeshare segment, and a $10 million reduction in foreign exchange gains, offset by $6 million of lower litigation expenses. Operating income increased 17 percent to $377 million in 2003. The favorable comparisons to 2002 include the impact of the $50 million write down of goodwill recorded in 2002 associated with our ExecuStay business, the 2003 receipt of $36 million of insurance proceeds associated with lost management fees resulting from the destruction of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel and lower 2003 operating losses from our synthetic fuel operation. In 2003, the synthetic fuel business generated operating losses of $104 million, compared to $134 million in 2002. Operating income in 2003 was hurt by $53 million of lower incentive fees, which resulted from the weak operating environment in domestic lodging. General, administrative and other expenses increased $13 million in 2003 to $523 million, reflecting higher litigation expenses related to two continuing and previously disclosed lawsuits, partially offset by the impact of the additional week in 2002 (our 2002 fiscal year included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2003). The expenses also reflect foreign exchange gains of $7 million, compared to losses of $6 million in 2002.
.@0001048286.@MAR.@2004-02-23.@We are a worldwide operator and franchisor of 2,718 hotels and related facilities.

As timeshare note sales are an integral part of the timeshare business, we include timeshare note sale gains in our timeshare segment results and we allocate other gains as well as equity income (losses) from our joint ventures to each of our segments. This historically challenging time in the lodging industry has demonstrated Marriott International’s resilience, the strength of our business model, superior brands, strong management team and dedicated associates. We are optimistic about a stronger business climate in 2004. And with the final disposition of our senior living and distribution services businesses in 2003, we look forward to operating as a focused lodging and timeshare company for the first time in our 76-year history. In 2003, we grew productivity at the hotel level leveraging our buying power and systems. Greater integration of sophisticated scheduling systems reduced hours worked per occupied room by over 10 percent in 2003 over 2000 levels for participating hotels. In addition, food and supply costs were reduced due to greater participation in our centralized procurement and accounts payable systems. By pooling risk among our managed hotel portfolio, we continued to purchase insurance at a lower cost than any property could purchase alone. By the end of 2003, we had high-speed internet access available in approximately 1,400 hotels, far outpacing our competition. We also introduced wireless internet access in lobbies, meeting rooms and public spaces in over 900 hotels in the U.S. during the year. Revenues from continuing operations increased 7 percent to $9 billion in 2003 reflecting revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by lower demand for hotel rooms and consequently lower fees to us. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 8 percent to $476 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 11 percent to $1.94. Synthetic Fuel operations contributed $96 million in 2003 compared to $74 million in 2002. Our lodging financial results declined $5 million, to $702 million in 2003. The comparisons from 2002 benefit from the $50 million pretax charge to write-down acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay in 2002, offset by the $44 million pretax gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International in 2002, and further benefit from our 2003 receipt of a $36 million insurance settlement for lost management fees associated with the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. Revenues from continuing operations increased 8 percent to $8.4 billion in 2002 reflecting the sales of our new Synthetic Fuel operation and revenue from new lodging properties, partially offset by a slowdown in the economy and the resulting decline in lodging demand. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, increased 63 percent to $439 million, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations advanced 66 percent to $1.74. Income from continuing operations reflected $74 million associated with our synthetic fuel operation, the results also reflected a $44 million pretax 2002 gain on the sale of our investment in Interval International, offset by the $50 million pretax 2002 charge to write-down the acquisition goodwill for ExecuStay and the decreased 2002 demand for hotel rooms and executive apartments. The comparisons to 2001 include the impact of the $204 million pretax restructuring and other charges that we recorded against continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2001.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2019-11-15.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations, including Thailand, France, and the Netherlands, to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific ("CAP") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks ReserveTM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. As a result, we have three reportable operating segments: Americas, International and Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. We also made certain other immaterial changes. Concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. Our U.S. corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21%, while a blended rate of 24.5% was applied in fiscal 2018. Total net revenues increased 7% to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $24.7 billion in fiscal 2018. Consolidated operating income increased to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2019 operating margin was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in fiscal 2018. Operating margin compression in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by partner (employee) investments and growth in wages and benefits, licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and other strategic investments. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, lower restructuring and impairment costs and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2019 decreased to $2.92, compared to EPS of $3.24 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year gains from the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the sale of our Tazo brand, partially offset by the gain from the sale of our Thailand retail operations during fiscal 2019. Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018. We returned $12.0 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2019 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $8.9 billion in fiscal 2018. Total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million). Other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance. Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales, largely driven by price increases. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. Other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million). Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to TeavanaTM/MC retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million). Income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018. Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. Interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded store value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year. Interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further discussion. Total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million). Other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue due to the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million). Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues were flat, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment. Other operating expenses increased $37 million, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestlé. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points). General and administrative expenses increased $300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 U.S. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vests over one year. Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and International restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million). Income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2018-11-16.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow growth activities. These efforts primarily include the acquisition of our East China joint venture, the conversion of our Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, the closure of TeavanaTM/MC retail stores, the sale of the Tazo brand, the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, and the closure of certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, among other actions. These streamlining efforts span across all segments and our corporate functions. On August 26, 2018, our Channel Development segment finalized licensing and distribution agreements with Nestlé to sell and market our CPG and foodservice products. The scope of the arrangement converts the majority of our previously defined Channel Development segment operations, as well as certain smaller businesses previously reported in the Americas, EMEA and Corporate and Other (previously All Other Segment), from company-owned to licensed operations with Nestlé. As a result, we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established Global Coffee Alliance. Our reportable segments have been restated as if those smaller businesses were previously within our Channel Development segment. Concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. Further, in an effort to report operating expenses in line with the corresponding revenue generating activities, we have changed the classification of certain costs, primarily within our CAP segment and mainly from other operating expenses to general and administrative expenses. This reclassification has been retrospectively applied and was determined to be immaterial. Starbucks largest acquisition to date affects our CAP segment. As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in our East China joint venture at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we began recording 100% of its revenues and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is in contrast with our previous joint venture model, where we recorded only revenues and expenses from products sales to and royalties received from East China, as well as our proportionate share of the joint venture's net profit. The change from equity method to consolidation method lowered the operating margin of our Consolidated and CAP segment, primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower income from equity investees. Starbucks results for fiscal 2018 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. Consolidated total net revenues increased 10% to $24.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,997 net new store openings over the past 12 months, incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China, 2% growth in global comparable store sales and favorable foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the closure of our TeavanaTM/MC retail stores, initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and substantially ceased during fiscal 2018 and the sale of our Singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Consolidated operating income declined $251 million, or 6%, to $3.9 billion. Operating margin declined 280 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, largely in the Americas segment, the impact of our ownership change in East China, higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. Earnings per share of $3.24 increased 64% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.97. Americas revenue grew by 7% to $16.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 895 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 2%, partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the conversion of our Brazil retail business to fully licensed operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income declined $39 million to $3.6 billion and operating margin of 21.6% declined 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, increased investments in our store partners and the impact of the May 29th anti-bias training. These increases were partially offset by sales leverage. In our CAP segment, revenue grew by 38% to $4.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, incremental revenues from 756 net new stores over the past 12 months. These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income grew 13% to $867 million, while operating margin declined 420 basis points to 19.4%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China. We now operate 8,530 stores in 15 markets in our CAP segment making this our second largest reportable segment. In our EMEA segment, revenue grew by 9% to $1.0 billion, primarily driven by increased revenues from the opening of 356 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and favorable foreign currency translation. Operating margin declined 400 basis points to 5.9% primarily due to higher impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business and restructuring costs, including severance, asset impairments and business process optimization expenses. These decreases were partially offset by lapping of a prior year tax settlement. Channel Development segment revenues grew by 2% to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products, lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment and favorable foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by the net impact from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé beginning on August 26, 2018. Operating income declined $40 million, or 4%, to $927 million. Operating margin declined 250 basis points to 40.4%, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from Nestlé, Global Coffee Alliance headcount related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs, and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand. Total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million). Other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations (approximately 20 basis points) and the 2018 U.S. stock award (approximately 20 basis points). Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and EMEA restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million). Income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consists of sales of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. The gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our Singapore retail operations. Interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by lapping the gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc. warrants in the prior year period. Interest expense increased $78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018 and August 2018. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that is not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the Tax Act (approximately 480 basis points). The impact from the Tax Act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). This favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points). See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further discussion. Total net revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increased revenues from company operated stores ($807 million). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue ($201 million), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new Starbucks® licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million). Other revenues increased $64 million, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee, tea and premium single-serve products ($73 million), our ready-to-drink beverages ($21 million) and higher foodservice sales ($26 million). Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($47 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to 2017 ($13 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by a product mix shift (approximately 70 basis points) largely towards premium food in the Americas segment, partially offset by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment (approximately 150 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 90 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 30 basis points), and employment taxes, including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points). These were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. Restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in Teavana. We recorded $130 million of restructuring–related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment charge of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our Switzerland retail business. Income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our CAP joint venture operations, primarily China and South Korea, as well as our North American Coffee Partnership. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.  Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased $88 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($84 million). Interest income and other, net increased $79 million, primarily driven by gain in our investment in Square, Inc. warrants ($41 million) and higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($44 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2016, May 2016 and March 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our December 2016 notes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points) and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points). The increase was partially offset by the largely non-taxable gain on the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points).
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2017-11-17.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2017 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. Consolidated total net revenues increased 5% to $22.4 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 2,320 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 3% growth in global comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. Consolidated operating income declined $37 million, or 1%, to $4.1 billion. Operating margin declined 110 basis points to 18.5%, primarily due to increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment, restructuring and impairment charges and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage. Earnings per share of $1.97 increased 4% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.90. Americas revenue grew by 6% to $15.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 952 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 3%, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. The success of our premium food offerings coupled with innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms drove the increase in comparable store sales. Operating income declined $79 million to $3.7 billion and operating margin at 23.4% declined by 190 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to increased investments in our store partners, a product mix shift largely towards food, and the absence of the 53rd week. These were partially offset by sales leverage. In our China/Asia Pacific segment, revenues grew by 10% to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 1,036 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Operating income grew 21% to $765 million, while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.6%. The overall margin expansion was primarily due to the transition to China's new value added tax structure in fiscal 2016 and higher income from our joint venture operations. We now operate 7,479 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment making this the second largest reportable segment. We continue to execute on our strategy of repositioning the EMEA segment to a predominantly licensed model. As a result of this strategy, EMEA revenues declined $111 million to $1.0 billion, or 10%, primarily driven by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting the decrease were incremental revenues from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. Operating margin declined 200 basis points to 11.5% primarily due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business, sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores. Channel Development segment revenues grew by 4% to $2.0 billion, primarily driven by increased sales through our international channels and sales of packaged coffee, foodservice and single-serve products. When excluding the revenue of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, segment revenues grew by 6%. Operating income grew $86 million, or 11%, to $893 million. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 44.5%, primarily driven by lower coffee costs, leverage on cost of sales and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. Total net revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($807 million). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue ($201 million), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new Starbucks® licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million). CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $64 million, driven by increased sales through our international channels, primarily associated with our European and North American regions ($35 million), increased sales of U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million), foodservice ($30 million) and premium single-serve products ($23 million). Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($47 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to fiscal 2017 ($13 million).  Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by a product mix shift (approximately 70 basis points) largely towards premium food in the Americas segment, partially offset by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment (approximately 150 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 90 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 30 basis points), and employment taxes, including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points). These were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. Restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in Teavana. We recorded $130 million of restructuring–related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our Switzerland retail business. Income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our CAP joint venture operations, primarily China and South Korea, as well as our North American Coffee Partnership. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. Interest income and other, net increased $167 million, primarily driven by gains from the sale of our Singapore retail operations ($84 million) and our investment in Square, Inc. warrants ($41 million). Also contributing favorably was higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($44 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2016, May 2016 and March 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our December 2016 notes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points), and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points). The increase was partially offset by the largely non-taxable gain on the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points). Total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.6 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million). CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $214 million, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products ($106 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($47 million), and increased foodservice sales ($34 million) and U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 50 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 50 basis points), the lapping of impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points). Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points due to higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily from our North American Coffee Partnership and our joint ventures in China and South Korea. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the “2017 notes”), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount. Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2016-11-18.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2016 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). Our net revenues grew 11% over fiscal 2015, and consolidated operating margin expanded 80 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.6% in fiscal 2016, largely driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our partners and digital platforms. The Americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2016, with revenues growing 11% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in number of transactions, incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the last 12 months and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Growth in our iced beverages, including coffee, tea and espresso, paired with beverage innovation and the success of our food offerings, drove the increase in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 110 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our store partners and digital platforms. Our fiscal 2016 China/Asia Pacific segment results reflected higher revenues from the opening of 981 net new stores over the past year, incremental revenues associated with the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, a 3% increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales leverage, higher income from our joint venture operations and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures in China. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan. We now operate 6,443 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment with continued strong performance, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. As we continue to execute our strategy of achieving the appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores, our EMEA segment revenues declined 8% to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to a year ago. The decline in revenues was primarily driven by lower company-operated store revenues due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting lower company-operated store revenues were higher licensed store sales, primarily resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Compared to fiscal 2015, EMEA operating margin declined 30 basis points to 13.5% primarily due to sales deleverage at certain company-operated stores and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores. The Channel Development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products, driven by sales of Starbucks® K-Cup® portion packs, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales. Operating margin increased 400 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, lower coffee costs and leverage on cost of sales. As seen through our Channel Development segment results for fiscal 2016, we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence. Total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.6 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million). CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $214 million, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products ($106 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($47 million), and increased foodservice sales ($34 million) and U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 50 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 50 basis points), the lapping of impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points). Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points due to higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily from our North American Coffee Partnership and our joint ventures in China and South Korea. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the "2017 notes"), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount. Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable. Total net revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 17%, over fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $2.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan ($1.1 billion), an increase in comparable store sales (7% growth, or $852 million) and incremental revenues from 550 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($590 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($252 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed $273 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from the opening of 1,075 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales as well as increased La Boulange food sales to our licensees in the Americas segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($45 million). CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products ($116 million), U.S. packaged coffee ($55 million) and foodservice sales ($40 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by sales and operating leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), driven by strong sales and initiatives in our supply chain, such as improvements in sourcing, as well as sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses were flat as a percentage of total net revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, due to the shift to more licensed stores in EMEA (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 100 basis points) in the Americas segment. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by increased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points), largely due to timing, the impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment (approximately 20 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 20 basis points). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 10 basis points). The $20 million decrease in litigation credit for fiscal 2015 was due to lapping a prior year credit related to a reduction of our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration, as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees decreased $18 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership and China joint ventures. As a percentage of total revenues, income from equity investees decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points). The overall increase in operating margin of 10 basis points was driven by the changes discussed above, including the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which contributed unfavorably to operating margin (approximately 90 basis points). During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the "2017 notes"), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount. Interest income and other, net decreased $100 million, primarily due to lapping the gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture ($68 million) in the prior year and net unfavorable fair value adjustments from derivative instruments used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations ($25 million) in fiscal 2015. Interest expense increased $6 million primarily due to incurring a full quarter of interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 on the long-term debt we issued in December of fiscal 2014 as well as the reclassification of $2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts associated with the 2017 notes redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.3% compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in the rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable, as well as the 1.5% incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed in fiscal 2015 on U.S. corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2011 through 2015.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2015-11-12.@ Starbucks results for fiscal 2015 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). Our net revenues grew 17% over fiscal 2014 and all reportable segments drove an increase in consolidated operating income. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 18.8% from 18.7% in fiscal 2014, largely driven by sales leverage, partially offset by the 90 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan as well as increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners (employees) in the Americas segment. The ownership change in Starbucks Japan reflects the change in accounting from a joint venture to a consolidated market and includes the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. The Americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2015, with revenues growing 11% to $13.3 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 7%, comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in number of transactions, as well as incremental revenues from 612 net new store openings over the last 12 months. Growth in our core beverages, paired with the success of our food offerings and beverage innovation, drove the increase in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 80 basis points to 24.2% in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and moderate margin expansion through new stores and leveraging investments in both our store partners (employees) and our digital platforms, such as Mobile Order and Pay. Our fiscal 2015 China/Asia Pacific segment results reflect the impact of fully consolidating Starbucks Japan since October 31, 2014. Incremental revenues from the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan were the primary driver of the 112% increase in segment revenues, to $2.4 billion. Also contributing were increased sales from the opening of 767 net new stores over the past year, along with a 9% increase in comparable store sales, primarily driven by an 8% increase in transactions. Operating income grew 34%, to $501 million, while operating margin declined 1,210 basis points to 20.9%. The overall operating margin decline was due to the 1,410 basis point impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, which was partially offset by 200 basis points of expansion primarily due to sales leverage. We expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company revenue growth in the future as we look forward to continued net new store openings and the first full year of consolidating Starbucks Japan. In fiscal 2016, we also expect China to continue to move towards being one of our largest international markets, primarily driven by expanding our retail store presence and increasing transaction growth. Our EMEA segment revenues declined 6% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $116 million. This was partially offset by revenue growth of $38 million that was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 238 net new licensed store openings over the past year. EMEA operating margin expanded 460 basis points to 13.8% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to sales leverage driven by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores. We expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance, with operating margin approaching 15% in fiscal 2016. The Channel Development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products, driven by sales of Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup® portion packs, and improved packaged coffee sales. Operating margin increased 180 basis points to 37.8%, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and increased income due to strong performance by our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. We continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence. For fiscal 2016, we expect moderate margin expansion primarily driven by growing our premium single-serve category with innovative new beverages, including the ready-to-drink market. Total net revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 17%, over fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $2.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan (approximately $1.1 billion), an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7% growth, or $852 million) and incremental revenues from 550 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $590 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation (approximately $252 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed $273 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from the opening of 1,075 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales as well as increased La Boulange food sales to our licensees in the Americas segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately $45 million). CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $116 million), U.S. packaged coffee (approximately $55 million) and foodservice sales (approximately $40 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by sales and operating leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), driven by strong sales and initiatives in our supply chain, such as improvements in sourcing, as well as sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses were flat as a percentage of total net revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, due to the shift to more licensed stores in EMEA (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 100 basis points) in the Americas segment. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by increased marketing (approximately 20 basis points), largely due to timing, the impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment (approximately 20 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 20 basis points). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 10 basis points). The $20 million decrease in litigation credit for fiscal 2015 was due to lapping a prior year credit related to a reduction of our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration, as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees decreased $18 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership and China joint ventures. As a percentage of total revenues, income from equity investees decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points). The overall increase in operating margin of 10 basis points was driven by the changes discussed above, including the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which contributed unfavorably to operating margin (approximately 90 basis points). During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the "2017 notes"), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as expenses related to the previously capitalized original issuance costs and accelerated amortization of the unamortized discount. Net interest income and other decreased $100 million, primarily due to lapping the gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million) in the prior year and net unfavorable fair value adjustments from derivative instruments used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $25 million) in fiscal 2015. Interest expense increased $6 million primarily due to incurring a full quarter of interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 on the long-term debt we issued in December of fiscal 2014 as well as the reclassification of $2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts associated with the 2017 notes redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.3% compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in the rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non taxable, as well as the 1.5% incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed in fiscal 2015 on U.S. corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Total net revenues were $16.4 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $641 million) and incremental revenues from 555 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $529 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $228 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 1,029 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $168 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $111 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $17 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, primarily driven by lower commodity costs (approximately 80 basis points), mainly coffee, and sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, and as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 60 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage (approximately 80 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, mainly due to lapping of costs associated with our leadership conference held in the prior year. The litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in fiscal 2013 reflects the charge we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge included $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The $20.2 million litigation credit recorded in fiscal 2014 reflects a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees increased $17 million, primarily due to improved performance from our joint venture operations in China, South Korea, and Japan, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin to 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in the prior year period. Net interest income and other increased $19 million over the prior year, primarily due to a net benefit from transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million), favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price and foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $14 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations (approximately $9 million), and realized gains on sales of investments (approximately $6 million). These increases were partially offset by lapping gains on the sales of our equity interests in our joint ventures in Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). Interest expense increased $36 million due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 34.6% compared to 103.8% for fiscal 2013. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lapping the 71.2% impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. The remaining change in the effective tax rate over fiscal 2013 was an increase of 2.0%, which was primarily due to net higher discrete benefits in the prior year. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate benefited from releasing certain tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2014 and a net tax benefit from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2014 was additional tax resulting from the sale of our Australian company-operated retail store assets and operations and our 50% equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2014-11-14.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2014 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner. All reportable segments contributed to strong revenue growth and collectively drove an increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin expansion. The Americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2014, with revenues growing 9% to $12.0 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in number of transactions. Enhanced food offerings, including the full rollout of our La Boulange™ food platform in the US, the impact of price increases in our retail stores and successful promotional beverages contributed to the growth in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 190 basis points to 23.4% in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through new stores and continued product innovation, targeted at driving growth across all geographies and all dayparts. We plan to continue to expand our beverage platforms and elevate our food program, in part with continued enhancements to our lunch options. In the EMEA segment, fiscal 2014 benefited from the significant performance improvement of this segment, reaching double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability compared to the prior year. Revenues grew 12% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Incremental revenues from 180 net new licensed store openings over the past year also contributed. EMEA operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 9.2% in fiscal 2014, primarily due to sales leverage and continued cost management, largely driven by the shift in our store portfolio to more licensed stores in this segment. We expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin over time. Our China/Asia Pacific segment results reflect the growth and strong performance of new stores in the region, including 250 company-operated and 492 licensed net new store openings over the past year. This new store growth, along with a 7% increase in comparable store sales, drove a 23% increase in total net revenues to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2014. Operating income grew $51.3 million, or 16%, to $373 million compared to the prior year. Operating margin declined 200 basis points primarily resulting from the shift in the composition of our store portfolio in this segment to more company-operated stores. We expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company profitability in the future. We look forward to continued new store openings and the acquisition and integration of Starbucks Japan, including expanding our presence into other channels in the Japan market, such as CPG, licensing and foodservice. We also expect that China will continue to grow toward being one of our largest markets outside of the US. Channel Development segment revenues grew 11% to $1.5 billion, in fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products. Lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 630 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2014. As we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores, including growing our presence in the premium single-serve category, we expect this segment to become a more significant contributor to future growth. Total net revenues were $16.4 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $641 million) and incremental revenues from 555 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $529 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $228 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 1,029 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $168 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $111 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $17 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, primarily driven by lower commodity costs (approximately 80 basis points), mainly coffee, and sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, and as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 60 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage (approximately 80 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, mainly due to lapping of costs associated with our leadership conference held in the prior year. The litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in fiscal 2013 reflects the charge we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge included $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The $20.2 million litigation credit recorded in fiscal 2014 reflects a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees increased $17 million, primarily due to improved performance from our joint venture operations in China, South Korea, and Japan, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin to 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in the prior year period. Net interest income and other increased $19 million over the prior year, primarily due to a net benefit from transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million), favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price and foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $14 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations (approximately $9 million), and realized gains on sales of investments (approximately $6 million). These increases were partially offset by lapping gains on the sales of our equity interests in our joint ventures in Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). Interest expense increased $36 million due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 34.6% compared to 103.8% for fiscal 2013. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lapping the 71.2% impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. The remaining change in the effective tax rate over fiscal 2013 was an increase of 2.0%, which was primarily due to net higher discrete benefits in the prior year. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate benefited from releasing certain tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2014 and a net tax benefit from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2014 was additional tax resulting from the sale of our Australian company-operated retail store assets and operations and our 50% equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture. Total net revenues were $14.9 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion). The increase in company-operated store revenue was driven by an increase in comparable store sales (7%, or approximately $720 million) and incremental revenues from 492 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $386 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $150 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 843 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $181 million, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $116 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $35 million). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 90 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage in our Americas segment (approximately 90 basis points) and store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 50 basis points). This was partially offset by the addition of Teavana and continued investment in our emerging brands (approximately 60 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. As a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by increased costs to support overall company growth and the costs related to our October Global Leadership Conference. Income from equity investees increased $41 million, primarily due to increased income from of our joint venture operations in Japan and China, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages. Litigation charge of $2,784.1 million reflects the accrual we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge includes $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The combination of the above resulted in an operating loss of $325.4 million and operating margin of (220) basis points. Net interest income and other increased $29 million over the prior year, primarily due to gains on the sale of the equity in our Chile and Argentina joint ventures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). These gains were partially offset by the absence of additional income recognized in the prior year associated with unredeemed gift cards following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws (approximately $29 million). Also offsetting the gains were unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2013 compared to favorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2012 from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $24 million). Income taxes for fiscal year 2013 resulted in an effective tax rate of 103.8% compared to 32.8% for fiscal year 2012. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Excluding the impact of the litigation charge, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to benefits from releasing certain tax reserves in fiscal 2013 and a further benefit in fiscal 2013 primarily relating to state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. These items were partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits relating to coffee procurement in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

Our strong revenue growth of 12% and continued segment margin expansion drove increased operating cash flows, which allowed us to both fund our growth initiatives and increase cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2013, with revenues growing 11% and comparable store sales growth of 7%. Strength in beverage innovation and promotions, operational improvements, and expanded food offerings all contributed to the increase in comparable store sales. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales leverage, store efficiencies, and lower commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive sales growth and profitability through new stores and enhanced product offerings, including the continued roll out of La Boulange™ bakery items into all of our company-operated stores by the end of fiscal 2014. In the EMEA segment, we are continuing to make steady progress toward long-term profitability in the region. Revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year, with licensed store revenue growth nearly offset by a decline in company-operated store revenues. This reflects the shift in our ownership structure, as we have closed underperforming company-operated stores and are focused on growing our licensed store base in profitable locations. Comparable store sales were flat year over year, but were modestly positive in the second half of fiscal 2013. EMEA operating margin improved to 5.5% in fiscal 2013 due to our ongoing cost management efforts and our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year. We expect the investments we are making in this segment will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin over time. Our CAP segment results reflect a combination of rapid new store growth and solid performance from our existing store base, including our joint venture operations in China and Japan. New store growth, along with a 9% increase in comparable store sales, drove a 27% increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2013. Operating income grew 27% to $321 million and operating margin was unchanged at 35%, primarily due to our rapid growth shifting away from our historically licensed model. We expect this segment will become a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability in the future, as we look forward to continued store openings and establishing China as our largest market outside of the US. Channel Development segment revenues grew 10% in fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased sales of premium single serve products. Lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 290 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2013. As we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores, including growing our presence in the premium single serve category, we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to our future growth. Our consolidated operating results included a litigation charge as a result of the conclusion of our arbitration with Kraft which resulted in a pretax charge to operating expenses of $2.8 billion. The conclusion of this litigation is described in more detail in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe we have adequate liquidity to fund this expected payment, both in the form of cash on hand and the expected issuance of additional debt in fiscal 2014. Total net revenues were $14.9 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion). The increase in company-operated store revenue was driven by an increase in comparable store sales (7%, or approximately $720 million) and incremental revenues from 492 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $386 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $150 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 843 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $184 million, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single serve products (approximately $116 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $37 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to lower commodity costs (approximately 50 basis points), driven by a decrease in coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 90 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage in our Americas segment (approximately 90 basis points) and store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 50 basis points). This was partially offset by the addition of Teavana and continued investment in our emerging brands (approximately 60 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. As a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) and decreased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by increased costs to support overall company growth and the costs related to our October Global Leadership Conference. Income from equity investees increased $41 million, primarily due to increased income from of our joint venture operations in Japan and China, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages. Litigation charge of $2,784.1 million reflects the accrual we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge includes $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The combination of the above resulted in an operating loss of $325.4 million and operating margin of (220) basis points. Net interest income and other increased $29 million over the prior year, primarily due to gains on the sale of the equity in our Chile and Argentina joint ventures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). These gains were partially offset by the absence of additional income recognized in the prior year associated with unredeemed gift cards following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws (approximately $29 million). Also offsetting the gains were unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2013 compared to favorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2012 from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $24 million). Income taxes for fiscal year 2013 resulted in an effective tax rate of 103.8% compared to 32.8% for fiscal year 2012.  The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Excluding the impact of the litigation charge, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to benefits from releasing certain tax reserves in fiscal 2013 and a further benefit in fiscal 2013 primarily relating to state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. These items were partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits relating to coffee procurement in the current year. Consolidated net revenues were $13.3 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 13.7%, or $1.6 billion over fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $902 million), driven by an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7%, or $680 million). Also contributing to the increase were incremental revenues from net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $184 million). Licensed store revenues contributed $203 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from improved comparable store sales and the opening of 665 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $494 million, primarily due to sales of Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup® portion packs launched in the CPG channel on November 1, 2011 (approximately $232 million). The benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea under the direct distribution model (approximately $78 million) and an increase in foodservice revenues (approximately $50 million) also contributed. Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 170 basis points, driven by increased commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points), primarily due to higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, due to increased Channel Development and licensed store revenues. Store operating expenses as a percent of company-operated store revenues decreased 10 basis points due to increased sales leverage. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. As a percentage of net revenues excluding company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 350 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by increased sales leverage (approximately 150 basis points), the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle’s Best Coffee® store closures in Borders bookstores (approximately 80 basis points) and a shift in the timing of marketing spend (approximately 60 basis points). Income from equity investees increased $37.0 million, primarily due to an increase in income from our North American Coffee Partnership (approximately $13 million), Japan (approximately $11 million) and Shanghai (approximately $10 million) joint venture operations. The combination of these changes, along with increased sales leverage on depreciation and amortization (approximately 40 basis points) and general and administrative expenses (approximately 40 basis points), resulted in an increase in operating margin of 20 basis points over fiscal 2011. Net interest income and other decreased $21 million over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in our previous joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million), partially offset by the recognition of additional income associated with unredeemed gifts cards in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately $29 million), following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2012 resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.8% compared to 31.1% for fiscal year 2011.  The rate increased in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2011 from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and the release of foreign valuation allowances.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2012-11-16.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2012 reflect the strength of our global business model. We continue to execute on our new regional operating model which we implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We now have four reportable operating segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); China / Asia Pacific ("CAP") and Channel Development. Each segment is managed by an operating segment president. Total net revenues increased 14% to $13.3 billion driven by global comparable store sales growth of 7% and a 50% increase in Channel Development revenue. This growth drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margin and net earnings compared to fiscal 2011. This helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $214 million for the year, equivalent to approximately 160 basis points of impact on operating margin. Our Americas business continued its strong momentum and contributed 75% of total net revenues in fiscal 2012. The revenue growth for the year was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. This sales growth, combined with a continued focus on operational efficiencies, drove increased sales leverage that offset the impact of higher commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue driving sales growth and profitability through continued store efficiency efforts, new store development, and expanding our pipeline of new product offerings to increase revenues throughout all dayparts. EMEA segment results reflect both the investments we have begun making as part of our transformation plan for the region, as well as the macro-economic headwinds we, and others, face there. This resulted in flat comparable store sales and operating income of $10 million for fiscal 2012, a decrease of $30 million compared to fiscal 2011. We started the year by putting in place a new leadership team that is focused on increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region, improving the profitability of the existing store base through a focus on revenue growth and operating costs, and identifying opportunities for new store growth through licensing arrangements. We expect the investments we are making as part of this transformation effort will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin; however, this turnaround will take time to gain traction. CAP segment revenues increased 31%, driven by new store growth and comparable store sales of 15%. This segment continues to grow rapidly and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability. We expect continued growth will be from a mix of new store openings and comparable store sales growth. China continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us as we remain on track to reach our goal of 1,500 stores in 2015. In addition, other key markets such as Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia all continue to be profitable and provide a solid foundation for continued growth in the region. Our Channel Development segment represents another important, profitable growth opportunity for us. Channel Development results were a solid contributor to overall revenue growth with a 50% increase in revenues primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs which launched at the start of fiscal 2012 and our transition to a direct distribution model for packaged coffee, which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. High commodity costs continued to be a significant drag on operating margin; however, despite these higher costs, operating income increased $61 million to $349 million for fiscal 2012. We expect continued innovation and new product offerings such as the Verismo™ system by Starbucks and Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages will drive further growth and profitability within this segment over time. Consolidated net revenues were $13.3 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 13.7%, or $1.6 billion over fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $902 million), driven by an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7%, or $680 million). Also contributing to the increase were incremental revenues from net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $184 million). Licensed store revenues contributed $203 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from improved comparable store sales and the opening of 665 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $494 million, primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs launched in the CPG channel on November 1, 2011 (approximately $232 million). The benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea under the direct distribution model (approximately $78 million) and an increase in foodservice revenues (approximately $50 million) also contributed. Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 170 basis points, driven by increased commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points), primarily due to higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, due to increased Channel Development and licensed store revenues. Store operating expenses as a percent of company-operated store revenues decreased 10 basis points due to increased sales leverage. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. As a percentage of net revenues excluding company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 350 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by increased sales leverage (approximately 150 basis points), the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle’s Best Coffee store closures in Borders bookstores (approximately 80 basis points) and a shift in the timing of marketing spend (approximately 60 basis points). Income from equity investees increased $37.0 million, primarily due to an increase in income from our North American Coffee Partnership (approximately $13 million), Japan (approximately $11 million) and Shanghai (approximately $10 million) joint venture operations. The combination of these changes, along with increased sales leverage on depreciation and amortization (approximately 40 basis points) and general and administrative expenses (approximately 40 basis points), resulted in an increase in operating margin of 20 basis points over fiscal 2011. Net interest income and other decreased $21 million over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in our previous joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million), partially offset by the recognition of additional income associated with unredeemed gifts cards in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately $29 million), following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2012 resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.8% compared to 31.1% for fiscal year 2011.  The rate increased in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2011 from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and the release of foreign valuation allowances. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be approximately 33%. Consolidated net revenues were $11.7 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 9%, or $993 million over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated store revenues driven by an 8% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $672 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 6% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $499 million) and a 2% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $173 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was favorable foreign currency translation (approximately $126 million) resulting from a weakening of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies and an increase in licensed store revenues (approximately $106 million). This increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points), mainly driven by increased coffee costs. Partially offsetting this increase was lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 70 basis points), driven by increased sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 170 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points primarily due to higher expenses to support the direct distribution model for packaged coffee and tea (approximately 40 basis points) and the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 (approximately 20 basis points). The above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 150 basis points for fiscal 2011. Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 300 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 50 basis points) and the gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 (approximately 30 basis points). These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points). Net interest income and other increased $66 million over the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from the gain recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million). Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2011 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.1% compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2010. The lower rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a benefit from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and to an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2011-11-18.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2011 reflect the strength and resiliency of our business model, the global power of our brand and the talent and dedication of our employees. Our business has performed well this year despite significant headwinds from commodity costs and a continuingly challenging consumer environment. Strong global comparable stores sales growth of 8% for the full year (US 8% and International 5%) drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings. This helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.20 per share for the year, equivalent to approximately 220 basis points of operating margin. Most of the commodity pressure was related to coffee, with dairy, cocoa, sugar and fuel accounting for the rest. Our US business continued its strong momentum and contributed 69% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011. We saw benefits from a variety of initiatives including our loyalty program, innovative products such as our Starbucks Petites® platform and other new food and beverage options. We also continued to refine our store efficiency efforts, including the rollout of our new point-of-sale and inventory management systems in our company-operated stores. The combination of these efforts resulted in strong comparable store sales of 8%, which translated to an increase in sales leverage, which more than offset the effect of higher commodity costs. Our international portfolio, which contributed 22% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011, continues to improve, with an operating margin of 13% for the year. We continue to leverage the valuable lessons learned from the turnaround of our US business, and continue to make progress on scaling the infrastructure of this segment. We are aggressively pursuing the profitable expansion opportunities that exist outside the US, including disciplined growth and scale in our more mature markets, and faster expansion in key emerging markets like China. Our global consumer products group (“CPG”) represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us. During the second quarter, we successfully transitioned our packaged coffee and tea businesses to an in-house direct model, away from the previous distribution arrangement. This model now gives us total control over the sell-in and distribution to retailers of these products. We also aggressively pursued the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee and other products in multiple forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels, leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base. Examples include the ongoing global expansion of our successful Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew product and Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup® portion packs which were added to the lineup at the start of fiscal 2012. CPG contributed 7% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011. Looking toward the future, we recently announced a reorganization of our leadership structure that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012. The new structure will enable us to accelerate our global, multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, and to leverage the talent, experience and expertise resident in our senior leadership team. In this new structure, one president will oversee all operations within each of three distinct regions with responsibility for the performance of company-operated stores, as well as for working with licensed and joint-venture business partners in each market within their respective region. The region president will also be responsible for working with Starbucks Global Consumer Products and Foodservice teams to further develop those businesses and execute against our growth plan within the region. The three new regions will be 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America, 2) China and Asia Pacific, and 3) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as the EMEA region. Consolidated net revenues were $11.7 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 9%, or $993 million over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by an 8% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $672 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 6% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $499 million) and a 2% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $173 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was favorable foreign currency translation (approximately $126 million) resulting from a weakening of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies and an increase in licensed stores revenues (approximately $106 million). This increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points), mainly driven by increased coffee costs. Partially offsetting this increase was lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 70 basis points), driven by increased sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 190 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points primarily due to higher expenses to support the direct distribution model for packaged coffee and tea (approximately 40 basis points) and the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 (approximately 20 basis points). The above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 150 basis points for fiscal 2011. Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 300 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 50 basis points) and the gain on the sale of properties (approximately 30 basis points). These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points). Net interest income and other increased $66 million over the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from the gain recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million). Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2011 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.1% compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2010. The lower rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a benefit from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and to an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 33%. Consolidated net revenues were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $551 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $298 million) and a 3% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $253 million). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million), foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million). This increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $119 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 50 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 80 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures. With the previously-announced store closures essentially complete, we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities. Partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses, which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. Net interest income and other increased $13 million over the prior period. The increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in France. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately $10 million. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $11 million), which related primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.0% compared to 30.1% for fiscal 2009. The lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2010-11-22.@Starbucks results for fiscal 2010 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts over the last two years to improve the health of our core business and to position the Company for sustained, profitable growth into the future. Strong comparable stores sales growth of 7% for the year (US 7% and International 6%), combined with a more efficient operating structure drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings. The operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal 2009 in our supply chain and company-operated stores have driven reduced product costs and store waste as well as in-store labor savings, concurrent with improved customer satisfaction scores. These improvements were partially offset by higher performance based compensation expenses in fiscal 2010 and by higher marketing expenses to support the launch of Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew in the grocery channel and the introduction of our new customizable Frappuccino® blended beverage. In our US business we will continue to refine our store efficiency efforts while pursuing a consistently high level of customer satisfaction. While the reinvigorated US business has been the primary driver of Starbucks improved consolidated financial results, the profitability of our international business continues to improve, driven primarily by increased sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. Our management continues to focus on our international business by leveraging the valuable lessons learned in the US. We intend to capitalize on the large expansion opportunities that exist outside the US, including continued growth and scale in our more mature existing markets, and emphasis on expansion in key emerging markets like China and Brazil. Our global consumer products group (“CPG”) represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee products in multiple forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels, leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base. Examples include the ongoing expansion of our successful Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew product and the ongoing growth in points of distribution for Seattle’s Best Coffee. Starbucks continues to generate strong operating cash flows, which provide us the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment and spending in both our core business and new growth platforms, while also returning cash to shareholders. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and finished the year with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and no short-term debt. In fiscal 2010 we returned approximately $460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Consolidated net revenues were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $551 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $298 million) and a 3% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $253 million). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million), foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million). This increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $119 million).  Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 50 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 80 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures. With the previously-announced store closures essentially complete, we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities. Partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses, which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. Net interest income and other increased $13 million over the prior period. The increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in France. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately $10 million. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $11 million), which relate primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.0% compared to 30.1% for fiscal 2009. The lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Company-operated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008, primarily attributable to a 6% decline in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decline in transactions and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction. Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in-store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of our restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in company-operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges. Net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts. Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on our trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, we had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2009-11-20.@Fiscal 2009 was a challenging year for Starbucks. The Company was confronted with extraordinary economic and operating challenges in addition to facing an increasingly competitive landscape. Although the global economy has shown some signs of improvement recently, management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many consumers are still facing and does not expect that to significantly change over the course of fiscal 2010. This challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending in the US and internationally, which in turn has impacted Company revenues, comparable store sales, operating income and operating margins. Starbucks responded to this difficult environment with a more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of initiatives to permanently improve the Company’s cost structure. The result is an underlying business model that is less reliant on high revenue growth to drive profitability, and that still preserves the fundamental strengths and values of the Starbucks brand. The primary initiatives in this strategy include rationalizing the global Company-operated store portfolio, right-sizing the non-retail support organization, and reducing the Company’s cost structure, while renewing the focus on service excellence in the stores and delivering relevant innovation. Starbucks actions to rationalize its global store portfolio have included the planned closure of nearly 1,000 Company-operated stores globally. At the end of fiscal 2009, nearly all of the approximately 800 US Company-operated stores, 61 stores in Australia and 41 Company-operated stores in other International markets had been closed. The remaining International store closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2010. Initiatives targeting reductions in the Company’s cost structure in fiscal 2009 proceeded as planned, with full-year costs of $580 million removed from the Company’s cost structure. These targeted cost reductions and associated operational efficiency efforts, along with a more profitable Company-operated store base, have moved Starbucks toward a more sustainable business model, while preserving the fundamental strengths and values of the brand. The operational efficiency efforts are primarily focused on store level execution and include improved staffing models and better management of waste in coffee, dairy and food. Starbucks actions to improve the customer experience have resulted in a more focused effort toward in-store offerings, and simplifying the demands on store partners (employees), while concurrently raising already-high standards for beverage and food offerings, customer service and the overall in-store experience. The effects of these efforts have already been seen in the Company’s improved customer satisfaction scores. Starbucks has a renewed focus on relevant product innovation and the disciplined expansion and leveraging of its existing products and sales channels. For example, Starbucks VIAtm Ready Brew coffee was launched in fiscal 2009 and is designed to capture a significant share of both the $21 billion global instant coffee category and the single-serve market. The Company intends to drive sales within the retail store base and CPG channels, both in the US and internationally. The Company continues to maintain a solid financial foundation, with no short term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2009 and with cash and liquid investments totaling more than $650 million. This solid financial position and continued strong cash flow generation have provided Starbucks with the financial flexibility to implement its restructuring efforts as well as make ongoing investments in its core business. Consolidated operating income was $562 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $504 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin improved to 5.7% compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2008. Cost reduction initiatives and related operational efficiency efforts contributed significantly to the margin improvement, offset in part by higher restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as Starbucks continued its work to rationalize its global store portfolio and support organization. EPS for fiscal 2009 was $0.52, compared to EPS of $0.43 reported in fiscal 2008. Restructuring charges impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2009 and restructuring and other transformation costs impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 in fiscal 2008. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008, while capital expenditures declined to $446 million in fiscal 2009 from $985 million in fiscal 2008. Available operating cash flow during fiscal 2009 was primarily used to reduce short-term borrowings to a zero balance in fiscal 2009, down from $713 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company realized approximately $580 million in reductions to its cost structure in fiscal 2009, with the initiatives focused on store closures, headcount reductions, in-store efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Company-operated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008, primarily attributable to a 6% decline in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decline in transactions and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction. Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. The Company derived 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. The decrease in Foodservice and other revenue was primarily due to the softness in the hospitality industry. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in-store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of Starbucks restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize the Company’s global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in Company-operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges. Net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts. Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on the Company’s trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. As described in more detail in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, the Company had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in Store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in fiscal 2008, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from specialty operations. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the foodservice business in the US. Since many of the Company’s operating expenses are fixed in nature, the softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales, and pressured operating margins. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in fiscal 2008. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Company’s leadership structure and non-store organization. Net interest income and other decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the Company’s trading securities portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its MDCP plan. The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Company’s issuance of $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for fiscal 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate was due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2008-11-24.@Throughout fiscal 2008, Starbucks continued to experience declining comparable store sales in its US stores, primarily due to lower customer traffic. With the US segment representing 76% of consolidated revenues, the impact of this decline on the Company’s financial results for fiscal 2008 was significant. For fiscal year 2008 comparable store sales declined 5% in the US, with a declining trend over the course of the year, ending with a decline of 8% in the fourth quarter. The Company also experienced declining comparable sales in Canada and the UK, its two largest Company-operated International markets, primarily due to lower traffic. The Company believes that the weaker traffic has been caused by a number of ongoing factors in the global economies that have negatively impacted consumers’ discretionary spending, as well as factors within the Company’s control with respect to the pace of store openings in the US and store level execution. In the US, the economic factors included the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food, rising levels of unemployment and personal debt, reduced access to consumer credit, and lower home values as well as increased foreclosure activity in certain areas of the country (California and Florida) where Starbucks has a high concentration of Company-operated stores. These developments combined with recent and ongoing unprecedented shocks to the global financial system and capital markets have all contributed to sharp declines in consumer confidence in the US. Starbucks business is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in customer traffic. Increased customer visits create sales leverage, meaning that fixed expenses, such as occupancy costs, are spread across a greater revenue base, thereby improving operating margins. But the reverse is also true — sales de-leveraging creates downward pressure on margins. The softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales. Since January 2008, when Company founder Howard Schultz reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman, Starbucks has taken steps to address the deterioration in the US retail environment and address its global support structure. These included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks Experience for the Company’s customers, increase customer traffic in its US stores, reduce infrastructure expenses, and improve the Company’s results of operations. These significant actions have been designed to structure the Company’s business for long-term profitable growth. As a result of the continued weak economy and decreased customer traffic, as well as the costs associated with the store closures and other actions in its transformation strategy, the Company’s fiscal 2008 results were negatively impacted in the following ways: consolidated operating income was $503.9 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin for the year was 4.9% compared with 11.2% in the prior year. Approximately 260 basis points of the decrease in operating margin was a result of restructuring charges, primarily related to the significant US store closures. Softness in US revenues along with higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses were also significant drivers in the margin decline. EPS for fiscal 2008 was $0.43, compared to EPS of $0.87 per share earned in the prior year. Restructuring charges and costs associated with the execution of the transformation agenda impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2008. The more significant actions taken by Starbucks in fiscal 2008 to transform and reinvigorate its business included: A plan to close approximately 600 underperforming Company-operated stores in the US market, of which 205 were closed as of fiscal year-end with the remaining stores to be closed by the end of fiscal 2009; Restructuring the Company’s Australia business by closing 61 Company-operated stores, focusing on the remaining 23 stores in three key metro areas; Reducing approximately 1,000 open and filled positions within the Company’s leadership structure and its non-store organization, to rationalize its infrastructure for the reduced number of stores; and Introducing new beverage platforms designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks beverage offerings, new breakfast food offerings and bakery and chilled foods, including health and wellness choices, and a new, everyday brewed coffee, Pike Placetm Roast, which returned the Company to the practice of grinding whole beans in stores and brewing every 30 minutes to provide customers with the freshest coffee possible. Management expects the Company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal 2009, both in the US and internationally, including in its two largest Company-operated markets of Canada and the UK. As the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified, other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, the Company expects to face an extremely challenging fiscal 2009 because of these economic conditions. Accordingly, Starbucks expects to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal 2009. Additionally, the Company’s earnings for fiscal 2009 will be impacted by lease termination and severance costs from the US and Australia store closures, totaling up to an estimated $0.12 of EPS for fiscal 2009. The Company estimates that the combination of the US and Australia store closures and head count reductions will result in a pre-tax benefit to operating income of approximately $200 million to $210 million in fiscal 2009, which equates to approximately $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS. Starbucks plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings, in both Company-operated and licensed markets, and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the global economy. Starbucks fiscal 2009 US store opening target is approximately a negative 20 net new stores, which includes a nearly 225 Company-operated store decline and approximately 205 net new licensed stores. Internationally, Starbucks is planning to open approximately 700 net new stores in fiscal 2009, two-thirds of which are expected to be licensed, as it factors in the current global economic climate, with a more cautious approach in the UK and western Europe. The United States and International segments both include Company-operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. Licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than Company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus Company-operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of Company-operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less-developed International segment. The Company’s International store base continues to increase and Starbucks has been achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for distribution of ready-to-drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready-to-drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring charges and amounts included in “Interest income and other, net” and “Interest expense” on the consolidated statements of earnings. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business. As discussed in the Management Overview section above, many of the Company’s operating expenses are fixed in nature. As a result, the softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales, and pressured operating margins. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Company’s leadership structure and non-store organization. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Interest income and other net, decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the Company’s trading securities portfolio. As described in more detail in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in “General and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Company’s issuance of $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate is due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007 increased from fiscal 2006, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Company’s CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased due to growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense for the US segment represents approximately 75% of the total Company’s dairy expense. For the US segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2007-11-29.@Starbucks achieved solid performance in fiscal 2007 — meeting its targets for store openings, revenue growth, comparable store sales growth, and earnings per share — despite a challenging economic and operating environment, and significant cost increases from dairy. The Company completed the fiscal year with encouraging trends and momentum in its International business but faced increasing challenges in its U.S. business. While U.S. comparable store sales were within the Company’s stated target range, it was accomplished through two price increases which offset flat-to-negative transaction count trends in the U.S. business. The pressure on traffic is consistent with similar trends reported across both the retail and restaurant industry. Management believes that the combination of the economic slowdown and the price increases implemented in fiscal 2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressures have impacted the frequency of customer visits to Starbucks stores. Consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased 21% to $9.4 billion. Company-operated retail revenues in fiscal 2007 rose 21% to $8.0 billion, predominantly due to the opening of 1,342 stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and 1% growth in the number of customer transactions. The Company opened a total of 2,571 new company-operated and licensed stores during the year, with 70% in the U.S. and 30% in International markets, to end the year with over 15,000 stores. For fiscal 2007, operating income increased to $1.1 billion, while operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 11.2% of total net revenues. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net earnings rose to $673 million in fiscal 2007 from $564 million for the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 increased to $0.87 compared to $0.71 a year ago. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, earnings grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. The United States and International segments both include Company-operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. The United States segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the United States segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the United States due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the United States segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the United States segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the United States segment has a higher operating margin than the less-developed International segment. The Company’s International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes the Company’s grocery and warehouse club business as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for distribution of ready-to-drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready-to-drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in “Net interest and other income” on the consolidated statements of earnings. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 21% to $9.4 billion from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2006, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $8.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $6.6 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased 19% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $861 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Company’s CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $387 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $343 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in new and existing accounts in the U.S. foodservice business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 42.5% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 40.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense for the U.S. segment represents approximately 75% of the total Company’s dairy expense. For the U.S. segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 40.8% for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.8% of total specialty revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 21.1% in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $467 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $387 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 4.9% for the fiscal 2007, compared to 5.0% for fiscal 2006. General and administrative expenses increased to $489 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $479 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 6.1% for fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased 15% to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $94 million for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating income increased 18% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $894 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 11.2% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 11.5% for fiscal 2006. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net interest and other income was $2 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from a higher level of borrowings outstanding, which include the $550 million of senior notes issued in August 2007, offset in part by a higher amount of income recognized on unredeemed stored value card and gift certificate balances in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2007 resulted in an effective tax rate of 36.3%, compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2007, with quarterly variations. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 19% to $673 million from $564 million for fiscal 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.87 for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $0.71 per share for fiscal 2006. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in fourth quarter 2006, earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,156 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2% for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation. The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of new accounting requirements to expense stock-based compensation at the beginning of its fiscal first quarter of 2006. Under the transition provisions allowed, it adopted the new requirements on a prospective basis and the financial statements for fiscal 2005 and prior years do not include stock-based compensation expense. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.1% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 19.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new international markets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006, from 5.3% for fiscal 2005. General and administrative expenses increased to $479 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $362 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation expense, additional employees to support continued global growth, and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for fiscal 2006, from 5.7% for fiscal 2005. Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal 2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006, from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances, offset in part by the recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005. Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005, the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the Company had established a contingent liability, and to increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax planning strategies.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2006-12-14.@During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the Company’s focus on execution in all areas of its business, from U.S. and International Company-operated retail operations to the Company’s specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance. Management believes that its ability to achieve the balance between growing the core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long-term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2006 performance reflects the Company’s continuing commitment to achieving this balance. The primary driver of the Company’s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both Company-operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Company’s objective to establish Starbucks as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Starbucks opened 2,199 new stores in fiscal 2006 and plans to open approximately 2,400 in fiscal 2007. With a presence in 37 countries, serving customers more than 40 million times per week, management continues to believe that the Company’s long-term goal of approximately 20,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 20,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company-operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers. The strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, introducing innovative products and improving speed with service through training, technology and process improvement. Global comparable store sales for Company-operated markets increased by 7%, making fiscal 2006 the 15th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of 5% or greater. Comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of 3% to 7%. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks shares operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores. Internationally, the Company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop. In January 2006, the Company increased its equity ownership from 5% to 100% in its operations in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2006 purchased a 90% stake in its previously-licensed operations in Beijing, China. The combination of more retail stores, comparable store sales growth of 7% and growth in other business channels in the U.S., International, and CPG operating segments resulted in a 22% increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005. The Company expects revenue growth of approximately 20% in fiscal 2007, consistent with its three to five year revenue growth target. Operating income as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 11.5% in fiscal 2006 from 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation. Net earnings increased by 14% in fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005. Reported operating margin and net earnings include the effects of stock-based compensation in fiscal 2006, while stock-based compensation expense was not included in the Company’s consolidated financial results in fiscal 2005. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by sustained popularity of core products, new product innovation and a high level of customer satisfaction. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,159 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2% for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.6% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 20.2% in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new international markets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006, from 5.3% for fiscal 2005. General and administrative expenses increased to $473 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $357 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation expense, additional employees to support continued global growth, and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for fiscal 2006, from 5.6% for fiscal 2005. Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a result of new store openings.

The operating margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006, from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances, offset in part by the recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005. Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005, the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the Company had established a contingent liability, and to increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax planning strategies. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $4.5 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Company-operated retail revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The increase in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian markets. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product licensed operations, increased 19% to $673 million for the 52-week period of 2005, from $566 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 926 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $304 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%, primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the Company’s emerging entertainment business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the 53-week period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program in Company-operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800 Company-operated stores had the lunch program at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues were 40.2% for both the 52-week period of fiscal 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher payroll-related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent Starbucks Experience in existing stores. In order to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher number of Drive Thru locations over the past year and extended store operating hours, which contributed to the higher payroll-related expenditures. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, decreased to 20.2% of specialty revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice businesses, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company’s emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle’s Best Coffee licensed café operations. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $340 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the corresponding 53-week fiscal 2004 period. General and administrative expenses increased to $357 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of both domestic and international business growth and increased charitable donations to support multi-year corporate commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004. Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $606 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $16 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its available-for-sale securities. Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other provision adjustments.
.@0000829224.@SBUX.@2005-02-16.@During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005, all areas of Starbucks business, from U.S. and International Company-operated retail operations to the Company’s specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance. Starbucks believes the Company’s ability to achieve the balance between growing its core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long-term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2005 performance reflects the Company’s continuing commitment to achieving this balance. The primary driver of the Company’s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both Company-operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Company’s objective to establish Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world. Starbucks opened 1,672 new stores in fiscal 2005 and plans to open approximately 1,800 in fiscal 2006. With a presence in 37 countries, management continues to believe that the Company’s long-term goal of 15,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 15,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company-operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers. The strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, introducing innovative products and improving the speed of service through training, technology and process improvement. Global comparable store sales for Company-operated markets increased by 8%, making fiscal 2005 the 14th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of five percent or greater. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of three to seven percent. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks leverages the expertise of local partners and shares its operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores. Internationally, the Company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop. The combination of more retail stores, higher revenues from existing stores and growth in other business channels in both the United States and International operating segments resulted in a 20% increase in total net revenues for the 52 weeks of fiscal 2005, compared to the 53 weeks of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total net revenues increased 23%. Both of these revenue growth measures were at or above the Company’s three to five year target of approximately 20%. The Company’s International operations delivered improved operating results, primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base. In recent fiscal years, the Company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel, as well as established more efficient distribution networks. Such investments have been and will continue to be necessary to support the Company’s planned international expansion, which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation. Since both additional International and U.S. retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities, the Company’s infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement. In fiscal 2005, operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 12.3% from 11.5% in fiscal 2004, and net earnings increased by 27%, compared to fiscal 2004. These results demonstrated the Company’s ability to improve operating margin while at the same time making strategic investments in the core retail business and in emerging specialty channels. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $4.5 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Company-operated retail revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. The increase in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian markets. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product licensed operations, increased 19% to $673 million for the 52 week period of 2005, from $566 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 937 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $304 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%, primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the Company’s emerging entertainment business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the 53-week period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program in Company-operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800 Company-operated stores had the lunch program at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues were 40.2% for both the 52-week period of fiscal 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher payroll-related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent Starbucks Experience in existing stores. In order to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher number of drive-thru locations over the past year and extended store operating hours, which contributed to the higher payroll-related expenditures. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.2% of specialty revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice businesses, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company’s emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle’s Best Coffee licensed café operations. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $340 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the corresponding 53-week fiscal 2004 period. General and administrative expenses increased to $357 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of both domestic and international business growth and increased charitable donations to support multi-year corporate commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004. Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drink, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $607 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $16 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its available-for-sale securities. Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 is expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 30% to $5.3 billion from $4.1 billion for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During the fiscal year ended 2004, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 29% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $3.4 billion for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Company-operated retail revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 9% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from its Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 34% to $837 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $626 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 31% to $820 million. Licensing revenues increased 38% to $566 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $410 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the addition of 710 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. The growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses was a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods, Inc., which included the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo® teas, and the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Foodservice and other revenues increased 25% to $271 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $216 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, which benefited from the July 2003 acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 41.4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, from 41.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, partially offset by leverage gained on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed expenses. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.2% in fiscal 2004, from 40.0% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher marketing expenditures for holiday and new product promotions, as well as increased costs to maintain retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.5% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 22.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll-related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $289 million in fiscal 2004, from $245 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the Company’s foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.5% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the corresponding 52-week fiscal 2003 period, primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004. General and administrative expenses increased to $304 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $245 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003. Income from equity investees was $59 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $37 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® coffee drink, and improved profitability of Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The July 2003 increase in the Company’s ownership interest from 5% to 50% in the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth. Operating income increased 44% to $607 million in fiscal 2004, from $421 million in fiscal 2003. The operating margin increased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 10.3% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed operating costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $14 million in fiscal 2004, from $12 million in fiscal 2003. The growth was a result of interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances during fiscal 2004, compared to the prior year. Income taxes for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3%, compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer nondeductible losses were generated from international markets, which are in various phases of development.
.@0000766704.@WELL.@2019-02-25.@Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower™, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, resident fees/services and rental income represented 69% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues.  Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan, and any interest rate adjustments. Our primary sources of cash include resident fees/services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, our commercial paper program, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $215,376,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $100,753,000 of restricted cash and $1,853,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. Capital  The following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred and supported new investments made during the year ended December 31, 2018: In April 2018, we issued $550,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028 for net proceeds of approximately $545,074,000. In connection with the QCP acquisition, in July 2018, we drew on a $1,000,000,000 term loan facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other expenses. In August 2018, we issued $200,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2028, $600,000,000 of 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500,000,000 of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2048 for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,283,226,000. Proceeds from these issuances were used to repay advances under the $1,000,000,000 term loan facility drawn on in July 2018 and the primary unsecured credit facility. In July 2018, we closed on a new $3,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across both our line of credit and term loan facility and terminated the existing unsecured credit facility. The credit facility includes a $3,000,000,000 revolving credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.825% over LIBOR, a $500,000,000 USD unsecured term credit facility at a borrowing rate of 0.90% over LIBOR and a $250,000,000 CAD unsecured term credit facility at 0.90% over CDOR. We extinguished $306,553,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.36%. We repaid our $450,000,000 of 2.25% senior unsecured notes at par upon maturity on March 15, 2018.  We raised $794,649,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our Equity Shelf Program (as defined below). Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees/services,rent and interest income. Our primary expenses include interest expense, depreciation and amortization, property operating expenses, other expenses and general and administrative expenses.  We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and SSNOI and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below.  Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations. The following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us. Fluctuations in resident fees/services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions, segment transitions and the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates. The fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. The decrease in other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily a result of insurance proceeds received during 2017 relating to a property as well as a bargain purchase gain recognized in conjunction with a single property acquisition.  During the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fluctuations in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. Beginning January 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized. The 2017 and 2018 decreases in rental income are primarily attributable to the disposition of properties exceeding new acquisitions, segment transitions and the reduction in the Genesis HealthCare ("Genesis") annual cash rent obligation due to the restructuring of the master lease as of January 1, 2018. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the CPI do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  For the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had 17 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.18% to 0.76% in our triple-net portfolio. The decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during the three years presented. The increase in other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to $10,805,000 of net lease termination fees recognized. Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties exceeding acquisition and segment transitions. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly. The provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies” below and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded provision for loan losses related to certain first mortgage loans to Genesis of $62,966,000 and $6,935,000, respectively. During the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fluctuations in gains on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. Beginning January 1, 2017, transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price.

Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties.  These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the CPI do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we had no triple-net lease renewals but we had 25 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.15% to 0.36% in our triple-net portfolio. The 2017 decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the volume of loan payoffs during 2016 and 2017 and the 2016 increase is attributable to higher loan volumes during the majority of 2016. The increases in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties from which we receive rent. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the CPI.  These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  If the CPI does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  Revenue from real property that is sold would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that revenues from sold properties exceed those from new acquisitions, we would experience decreased revenues.  Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  For the three months ended December 31, 2017, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 79,129 square feet of new leases and 270,505 square feet of renewals.  The weighted-average term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $32.92 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $11.43 per square foot.  Substantially all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in CPI to 3.5%. The fluctuation in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating expenses.  The fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan loss related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies” below and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.  During 2016 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges related to certain held-for-sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell.

The Company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience.  WelltowerTM, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties.  Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our customers/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2016, rental income and resident fees represented 39% and 59%, respectively, of total revenues.  Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and services, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had $419,378,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $187,842,000 of restricted cash and $2,313,122,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. We believe the capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we raised $1,235,138,000 in aggregate gross proceeds through the issuance of common stock and unsecured debt. The capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility, supported pro rata gross new investments of $3,007,040,000 for the year. We expect attractive investment opportunities to remain available in the future as we continue to leverage the benefits of our relationship investment strategy. In March 2016, we issued $700,000,000 of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2026, generating approximately $688,560,000 of net proceeds.  In May 2016, we closed on a new primary unsecured credit facility that includes a $3,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, a $500,000,000 unsecured term credit facility and a $250,000,000 Canadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility plus an option to upsize the unsecured revolving credit facility and the $500,000,000 unsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $1,000,000,000, in the aggregate, and the $250,000,000 Canadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $250,000,000.  The facility also allows us to borrow up to $1,000,000,000 in alternate currencies.  Based on our current credit ratings, the unsecured revolving credit facility is priced at 0.90% over LIBOR with a 0.15% annual facility fee and the unsecured term credit facilities are priced at 0.95% over LIBOR for the U.S. tranche and CDOR for the Canadian tranche.  The unsecured term credit facilities mature on May 13, 2021 and the unsecured revolving credit facility matures on May 13, 2020. The unsecured revolving credit facility can be extended for two successive terms of six months each at our option.  Also, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we raised $527,530,000 through our dividend reinvestment program and our Equity Shelf Program (as defined below).

The following is a summary of our results of operations (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a large portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2012, rental income, resident fees and services and interest and other income represented 61%, 37%, and 2% respectively, of total revenues (including discontinued operations).  Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. Our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and services, borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also possible that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. At December 31, 2012, we had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $107.7 million of restricted cash and $2.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement.  Please see Note 21 of our consolidated financial statements for information regarding subsequent events that impact our liquidity. The capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we raised over $6.0 billion in aggregate gross proceeds through issuance of common and preferred stock, unsecured debt and a Canadian denominated term loan. The capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, supported $4.9 billion in gross new investments for the year. We expect attractive investment opportunities to remain available in the future as we continue to leverage the benefits of our relationship investment strategy. At December 31, 2012, we had a $2,000,000,000 unsecured line of credit arrangement that is described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  At December 31, 2012, we had no balance outstanding under the unsecured line of credit arrangement.  Please see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for subsequent event information regarding our unsecured line of credit arrangement. We have $6,145,457,000 of senior unsecured notes principal outstanding with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 6.50%, payable semi-annually. A total of $494,403,000 of our senior unsecured notes are convertible notes that also contain put features.   Please see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.   In addition, we have a $250,000,000 Canadian denominated unsecured term loan (approximately $251,054,000 USD at exchange rates on December 31, 2012.)  The loan matures on July 27, 2015 and includes an option to extend for an additional year at our discretion.  Total contractual interest obligations on senior unsecured notes and the Canadian term loan totaled $2,777,745,000 at December 31, 2012. We have consolidated secured debt with total outstanding principal of $2,311,586,000, collateralized by owned properties, with annual interest rates ranging from 1.00% to 10.00%, payable monthly. The carrying values of the properties securing the debt totaled $3,953,516,000 at December 31, 2012. Total contractual interest obligations on consolidated secured debt totaled $757,025,000 at December 31, 2012. Our share of non-recourse secured debt associated with unconsolidated entities (as reflected in the contractual obligations table above) is $416,914,000 at December 31, 2012.  Our share of contractual interest obligations on our unconsolidated entities’ secured debt is $66,555,000 at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we had operating lease obligations of $699,990,000 relating primarily to ground leases at certain of our properties and office space leases and capital lease obligations of $85,853,000 relating to certain lease investment properties that contain bargain purchase options. Purchase obligations include $2,047,400,000 representing the cash portion of the Sunrise merger and management business sale commitments discussed in Note 21 to our audited financial statements.  Purchase obligations also include unfunded construction commitments and contingent purchase obligations. At December 31, 2012, we had outstanding construction financings of $162,984,000 for leased properties and were committed to providing additional financing of approximately $213,255,000 to complete construction. At December 31, 2012, we had contingent purchase obligations totaling $79,963,000. These contingent purchase obligations relate to unfunded capital improvement obligations and contingent obligations on acquisitions. Upon funding, amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the property. Other long-term liabilities relate to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which is discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2012, we had total equity of $10,520,519,000 and a total debt balance of $8,450,347,000, which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 45%. Our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 33% at December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our adjusted interest coverage ratio was 3.31x and our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.58x. Also, at December 31, 2012, we had $1,033,764,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $107,657,000 of restricted cash and $2,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged.

We are an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio and our portfolio spans the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate, including seniors housing communities, skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life science facilities. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.  The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2011: Economic fundamentals leading into 2012 have set a generally positive pace with U.S. Gross Domestic Product growth projected to pick up through the coming year. However, there are several important caveats to note as the world economy continues to face headwinds and risks weigh to the downside. Positive outlooks are conditional on fiscal policy in payroll taxes and unemployment insurance benefits and upon the easing of the European debt situation. A repeat of volatility experienced in 2011 is likely in 2012, as perceptions about the strength of the U.S. economy and the Euro zone will vary over time as events unfold.   However, this volatility has led to increased interest in the historically stable returns provided by healthcare real estate. As a consequence of this interest, significant debt and equity investment capital was available to our sector in 2011 resulting in a record year of acquisition activity.  We participated in this growth and continue to actively invest and pursue investment opportunities that meet our strategic underwriting criteria.  Our strategy has resulted in robust portfolio growth and strong returns for our shareholders. With further industry consolidation anticipated in 2012, we expect to continue to our success.  We believe the opportunities in which we invest will continue to generate consistent, reliable and growing cash flows for our shareholders, regardless of economic volatility. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, customer and geographic location. Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable.

Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2010: The serious economic recession affecting the national and global economy has continued to impact all sectors, including, to a somewhat lesser degree, health care. Continuing mixed economic signals have made it difficult to predict when there might be a return to more normal and stable growth rates, employment levels and overall economic performance. Banks have remained cautious in their lending, but significant liquidity has been injected into the senior housing and care markets by various Government-Sponsored Enterprises. In addition, there is significant equity investment capital available for certain health care sectors, particularly medical office buildings. This has had the effect of keeping capitalization rates in these segments generally in line with or even below historic rates. Debt costs for REITs have generally declined over the past 12 months, and equity markets for health care REITs have remained open for the most part. As a consequence, while liquidity remained an important consideration in 2010, we have been more aggressive in pursuing attractive investment opportunities that meet our strategic and underwriting criteria. We have also been more active in accessing capital markets during this time. We believe the markets in which we invest will continue to offer stable returns during the economic downturn and significant growth potential as and when the economy begins to rebound. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, customer and geographic location.

.@0000766704.@WELL.@2010-02-26.@Health Care REIT, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust that invests in senior housing and health care real estate. Founded in 1970, we were the first REIT to invest exclusively in health care properties. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2009: The demand for health care services, and consequently health care properties, is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that national health expenditures will rise to $3.4 trillion in 2015 or 17.7% of gross domestic product (“GDP”). This is up from $2 trillion or 15.9% of GDP in 2005. Health expenditures per capita are projected to rise approximately 4.7% per year from 2005 to 2015. While demographics are the primary driver of demand, economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates. We believe the health care property market is less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors. Investor interest in the market remains strong, especially in specific sectors such as medical office buildings, regardless of the current stringent lending environment. As a REIT, we believe we are situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital markets due to our access to capital. The total U.S. population is projected to increase by 16.4% through 2030. The elderly are an important component of health care utilization, especially independent living services, assisted living services, skilled nursing services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care. The elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 76.6% through 2030. Most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital, a physician’s office or a senior housing facility. Therefore, we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate.  Health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases. We recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand. Health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services. We believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to the: Specialized nature of the industry which enhances the credibility and experience of our company; Projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates which ensures demand; and Recent Developments.  Both the Senate and House of Representatives have passed legislation to reform the U.S. health care system. By the time this report is released, final reform legislation may already have been passed. The legislation involves the expansion of insurance coverage primarily through reform of the private insurance market, as well as changes to existing government programs. The reform efforts are intended to lead to more efficient, effective care, reduce waste, and benefit the most efficient, quality-conscious providers. As a company, we are well-situated to respond to any changes in health care delivery and organization resulting from this legislation. Future reform, broadened insurance coverage, changes in Medicare and Medicaid, changes in provider reimbursement, and changes in health care sector funding could have a significant impact on our operators’ financial situation and strategy, which we will continue to monitor. Beginning in late 2007, the U.S. and global economy entered a serious recession. The current economic environment is characterized by a severe residential housing slump, depressed commercial real estate valuations, weakened consumer confidence, rising unemployment and concerns regarding inflation, deflation and stagflation. Numerous financial systems around the globe have become illiquid and banks have become less willing to lend to other banks and borrowers. Further, capital markets have become and remain volatile as risk is repriced and investments are revalued. Uncertainty remains in terms of the depth and duration of these adverse economic conditions. The conditions described above have created an environment of limited capital availability and increasing capital costs. This was most evident in the credit markets, where lending institutions cut back on loans, tightened credit standards and significantly increased interest rate spreads. The equity markets were characterized by sporadic accessibility until late 2008, when share prices in most sectors declined significantly. Continued volatility in the capital markets could limit our ability to access debt or equity funds which, in turn, could impact our ability to finance future investments and react to changing economic and business conditions. This difficult operating environment also may make it more difficult for some of our operators/tenants to meet their obligations to us. During 2008, our focus gradually shifted from investment to capital preservation. To that end, our efforts in 2009 were directed towards: liquidity, portfolio management and investment strategy. Liquidity has become increasingly important and we have concentrated our efforts on further strengthening our balance sheet. We raised over $1 billion in funds during each of 2008 and 2009 from a combination of common stock offerings, our dividend reinvestment plan, our equity shelf program, property sales and loan payoffs. As always, we will continue to closely monitor the credit and capital markets for opportunities to raise reasonably priced capital. Our investment approach has produced a portfolio that is very diverse with strong property level payment coverages. Yet, today’s adverse economic conditions can negatively impact even the strongest portfolio. Our portfolio management program is designed to maintain our portfolio’s strength through a combination of extensive industry research, stringent origination and underwriting protocols and a rigorous asset management process. For the short-term, we expect to fund our ongoing development projects and will evaluate new investments selectively and only when funding sources are clearly identified. However, we will continue to strengthen our existing customer relationships and begin to cultivate new relationships. We remain focused on preserving liquidity, but we intend to take advantage of what we believe will be increasingly attractive investment opportunities over time. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and geographic location.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, rental income and interest income represented 90% and 7%, respectively, of total gross revenues (including discontinued operations). Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process. We also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of $1.0 to $1.2 billion in 2010, comprised of new investments totaling $700,000,000 to $800,000,000 and funded new development of $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. We anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately $300,000,000 during 2010. It is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. At December 31, 2009, we had $35,476,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $23,237,000 of restricted cash and $1,010,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. Our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit. To the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital, we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations.

Continued volatility in the capital markets could limit our ability to access debt or equity funds which, in turn, could impact our ability to finance future investments and react to changing economic and business conditions. This difficult operating environment also may make it more difficult for some of our operators/tenants to meet their obligations to us. During 2008, our focus gradually shifted from investment to capital preservation. To that end, our efforts in 2009 will be directed towards: liquidity, portfolio management and investment rationalization. Liquidity became increasingly important and we concentrated efforts on further strengthening our balance sheet. We raised over $1 billion in funds during 2008 from a combination of three common stock offerings, our dividend reinvestment plan, our new equity shelf program, property sales and loan payoffs. As always, we will continue to closely monitor the credit and capital markets for opportunities to raise reasonably priced capital. Our investment approach has produced a portfolio that is very diverse with strong property level payment coverages. Yet, today’s adverse economic conditions can negatively impact even the strongest portfolio. Our portfolio management program is designed to maintain our portfolio’s strength through a combination of extensive industry research, stringent origination and underwriting protocols and a rigorous asset management process. For the short-term, we expect to fund our ongoing development projects and will evaluate new investments selectively and only when funding sources are clearly identified. However, we will continue to strengthen our existing customer relationships and begin to cultivate new relationships. As we enter 2009, we remain focused on preserving liquidity, but we intend to take advantage of what we believe will be increasingly attractive investment opportunities over time. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, operator/tenant and geographic location. Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us. To the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operator/tenant. Our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property, periodic review of obligor credit, periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks. Through these asset management and research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2008, rental income and interest income represented 91% and 7%, respectively, of total gross revenues (including discontinued operations). Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process. We also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. We expect to complete gross new investments of $600,000,000 in 2009, comprised of funded new development. We anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately $200,000,000 to $300,000,000 during 2009. It is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. At December 31, 2008, we had $23,370,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $154,070,000 of restricted cash and $580,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement. Our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit. To the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital, we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations.

The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2005: Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest in properties managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location.

In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2005, 87% of our real property was subject to master leases. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rental income and interest income represented 90% and 8%, respectively, of total gross revenues (including discontinued operations). Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. This lease structure initially generates lower revenues and earnings compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straight-lining, but enables us to generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making investments in additional facilities. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property.

We expect to complete gross new investments of $450,000,000 to $550,000,000 in 2006, including acquisitions of $300,000,000 and funded new development of $150,000,000 to $250,000,000. We anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 during 2006. It is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future. To the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. At December 31, 2005, we had $36,237,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $345,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. Net income available to common stockholders decreased 14% from 2004 and 11% from 2003 primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt totaling $21,484,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, and increases in interest expense, provision for depreciation and preferred stock dividends, offset by increases in rental income. Net income available to common stockholders increased 3% from 2003 to 2004 due to an increase in rental income offset by increases in interest expense and provision for depreciation. These changes are discussed in further detail below. Net income available to common stockholders decreased on a per share basis during 2005 due to the lower net income available to common stockholders discussed above and higher outstanding shares. Net income available to common stockholders decreased on a per share basis during 2004 primarily due to higher outstanding shares. On a fully diluted basis, average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 54,499,000, a 5% increase from 52,082,000 for the same period in 2004 and an 18% increase from 44,201,000 for the same period in 2003. The increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private common stock offerings and common stock issuances pursuant to our DRIP. The decrease in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2005 is primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt. The increase in FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily due to the increase in net income available to common stockholders. The increases in FAD are primarily due to the changes in net straight-line rental income offset by the losses on extinguishment of debt. Please refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information regarding FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS. The increases in EBITDA are primarily due to increases in net income, excluding interest expense and provision for depreciation. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest was 3.10 times for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with 3.24 times for the same period in 2004 and 3.50 times for the same period in 2003. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.47 times for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared with 2.77 times for the same period in 2004 and 3.01 times for the same period in 2003. Our coverage ratios declined from the prior years primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt and increases in interest expense. Please refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information regarding EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and net income. The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties from which we receive rent. See the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further information. In addition, as discussed above, prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. While this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends, it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. As of December 31, 2005, we had no leases expiring prior to 2009 with the exception of our master lease with Commonwealth Communities Holdings LLC. In October 2005, Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (“Kindred”) announced its intent to acquire Commonwealth. As part of this transaction, which closed on February 28, 2006, we leased the Commonwealth facilities to Kindred under two master leases. Interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to recognition of additional interest income of approximately $4,509,000 offset by loan payoffs. The additional interest income related to the payoffs of loans that were either on non-accrual or partial accrual and all contractual interest was received from the borrowers. Transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to $822,000 of extinguishment recoveries, $750,000 in termination fees as well as additional fees from loan payoffs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the $902,000 gain from the sale of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003. The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense, the provision for depreciation and the recognition of losses on extinguishment of debt. The increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense. This was partially offset by lower average interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap agreements. If we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt, our interest expense will increase. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 totaled $1,535,000, $875,000 and $665,000, respectively. On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. We receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. For the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, we generated $972,000 and $1,770,000, respectively, of savings related to our Swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding during 2003. The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us. See the discussion of investing activities in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further information. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation will change accordingly. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues (including revenues from discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2005, were 5.89% as compared with 6.54% and 5.55% for the same periods in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The change from 2004 to 2005 is due to increased costs to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives offset by a decrease in professional service fees and other operating costs as a result of focused expense control. Approximately one-half of the increases from 2003 to 2004 were related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. The remainder was comprised of increases relating to professional services fees (including costs associated with SOX compliance), taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator in December 2004. The change in loan expense was primarily due to increased costs in 2003 and 2004 related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, costs related to obtaining consents to modify the covenants under our senior unsecured notes and costs related to the issuance of senior unsecured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal. During the year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal.

We also invest in specialty care facilities. Founded in 1970, we were the first REIT to invest exclusively in health care facilities. As of December 31, 2004, long-term care facilities, which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, comprised approximately 93% of our investment portfolio. The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2004. nvestments include real estate investments and credit enhancements which amounted to $2,447,233,000 and $5,645,000, respectively. Revenues include gross revenues and revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.

We have investments in properties located in 35 states and managed by 50 different operators. Our primary objectives are to protect stockholders’ capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest primarily in long-term care facilities managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location. Substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our operators’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us.

To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator. Our monitoring process includes review of monthly financial statements for each facility, quarterly review of operator credit, annual facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facility-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks. Through these monitoring and research efforts, we are typically able to intervene at an early stage and address payment risk, and in so doing, support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment. In addition to our monitoring and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. We typically invest in or finance up to 90% of the appraised value of a property. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates. As of December 31, 2004, 85% of our real property was subject to master leases, 96% of our real estate investments were cross-defaulted with other investments relating to the same operator and 78% of our real property loans were cross-collateralized with other loans to the same operator. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rental income and interest income represented 90% and 9%, respectively, of total gross revenues. Prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. This lease structure will initially generate lower revenues, net income and funds from operations compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straight-lining, but will enable us to generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. This change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we anticipate making additional investments in health care related facilities. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property. Our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements, is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of secured debt. We believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and finance future investments. Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed $584,931,000 of gross new investments and had $62,584,000 of real property sales and mortgage loan payoffs, resulting in net investments of $522,347,000. We previously issued investment guidance indicating that we anticipated net new investments of $250,000,000 in 2005. We recently adjusted our net new investment guidance for 2005 to $200,000,000, due to the anticipated disposition of two investments totaling approximately $50,000,000 that were not in the original guidance. Although no additional investment payoffs have been specifically identified, we anticipate the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of additional real property. To the extent that mortgage loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any mortgage loan repayments and real property sales in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. At December 31, 2004, we had $19,763,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $189,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements. Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $72,634,000, or $1.39 per diluted share, as compared with $70,732,000, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $55,191,000, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. Net income available to common stockholders increased on a year-to-date basis primarily due to an increase in rental income offset by increases in interest expense and provision for depreciation. These changes are discussed in further detail below. Although net income available to common stockholders increased by 3% from 2003 and 32% from 2002, it decreased on a per share basis primarily due to significantly higher outstanding shares. On a fully diluted basis, average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2004 were 52,082,000, an 18% increase from 44,201,000 for the same period in 2003 and a 40% increase from 37,301,000 for the same period in 2002. The increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private common stock offerings, common stock issuances pursuant to our DRIP and conversions of preferred stock into common stock. The following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from January  1, 2003 to December 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands): FO for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $146,742,000, or $2.82 per diluted share, as compared with $119,463,000, or $2.70 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $96,573,000, or $2.59 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. The increase in FFO is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation. FAD for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $132,950,000, or $2.55 per diluted share, as compared to $104,535,000, or $2.36 per diluted share, for the same period in 2003 and $87,317,000, or $2.34 per diluted share, for the same period in 2002. The increase in FAD is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation offset by changes in rental income in excess of cash received. Please refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information regarding FFO and FAD and for reconciliations of FFO and FAD to NICS. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $238,264,000, as compared with $199,349,000 for the same period in 2003 and $155,208,000 for the same period in 2002. The increase in EBITDA is primarily due to increases in net income, interest expense and provision for depreciation. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest was 3.24 times for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.50 times for the same period in 2003 and 3.67 times for the same period in 2002. Our coverage ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges was 2.77 times for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 3.01 times for the same period in 2003 and 2.84 times for the same period in 2002. Our coverage ratios declined from the prior years primarily due to the fact that interest expense increased 29% to $73,431,000 from $56,912,000 in 2003 and 74% from $42,271,000 in 2002, whereas EBITDA only increased by 20% from 2003 and 54% from 2002. The increase in interest expense is discussed in further detail below. Please refer to the discussion of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information regarding EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and net income. The increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties for which we receive rent offset by sales of real property. Investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52 skilled nursing facilities for $518,891,000, including the assumption of debt totaling $14,555,000. The remaining $38,211,000 of real property investments related primarily to funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $9,523,000 related to construction advances on two assisted living facilities. For the same period in 2003, we acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing facilities for $474,385,000. However, the prior year acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling $101,243,000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling $26,500,000, resulting in $346,643,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $63,770,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $29,496,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. We converted $36,794,000 of completed construction projects relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into operating lease properties in 2003. For the same period in 2002, we acquired 24 assisted living facilities, 21 skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for $354,672,000. However, the 2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by $2,248,000, resulting in $352,424,000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions. In addition, we advanced $57,282,000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities. Of this amount, $19,595,000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold four assisted living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility, generating $37,567,000 of net proceeds. For the same period in 2003, we sold 14 assisted living facilities, two skilled nursing facilities and one parcel of land, generating $65,455,000 of net proceeds. For the same period in 2002, we sold nine assisted living facilities, generating $52,279,000 of net proceeds. As discussed above, prior to June 2004, our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators, which were generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period. Beginning in June 2004, our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the property. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. While this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends, it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize non-cash straight-line rent over time. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. As of December 31, 2004, we had no leases expiring prior to 2009. Interest income decreased from 2002 primarily due to lower average yields on our loans receivable and non-recognition of interest income related to loans on non-accrual. Interest income increased from 2003 primarily due to a full year of interest income on loans made in 2003 and recognition of interest income related to our mortgage loans with Doctors Community Healthcare Corporation as a result of the bankruptcy resolution. Transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to the $902,000 gain from the sale of our investment in Atlantic Healthcare Finance L.P. in October 2003 and the resulting lack of income subsequent to the date of sale. The increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense, the provision for depreciation and general and administrative expenses. The increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense. This was partially offset by lower average interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap agreements. In September 2002, we issued $150,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 8.05%, resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to three months of expense in 2002 and 12 months of expense in 2003. In March 2003, we issued $100,000,000 of 8.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in September 2012, at an effective yield of 7.40%, resulting in nine months of interest expense in 2003 compared to 12 months of expense in the current year. In November 2003, we issued $250,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in 2002 and one month of expense in 2003. In September 2004, we issued $50,000,000 of 6.0% senior unsecured notes, maturing in November 2013, at an effective yield of 5.68% resulting in three months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in the prior years. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2004 we had an average daily outstanding balance of $54,770,000 under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements compared to $61,677,000 and $69,180,000 during the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Also, in 2004, we assumed $14,555,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.50% in conjunction with new acquisitions. In 2003, we assumed $101,243,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.39% in conjunction with new acquisitions. In 2002, we assumed $2,248,000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 7.75% in conjunction with new acquisitions. Effective April 15, 2004, we repaid our $40,000,000 8.0% senior unsecured notes, which will result in a decrease of interest expense of $3,200,000 on an annualized basis. If we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements, issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt, our interest expense will increase. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 totaled $170,000, $1,535,000 and $875,000, respectively. On May 6, 2004, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements (the “Swaps”) for a total notional amount of $100,000,000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rate of $100,000,000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of November 15, 2013. The Swaps are treated as fair-value hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the short-cut method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The Swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 6.0% and pay a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR plus a spread. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated $1,770,000 of savings related to our Swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense. We had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. The provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us offset by sales of real property. See the discussion of rental income above for additional details. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation will change accordingly. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues (including revenues from discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2004, were 6.54% as compared with 5.55% and 5.79% for the same periods in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Approximately one-half of the increases from 2002 and 2003 are related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. The remainder is comprised of increases relating to professional services fees (including costs associated with SOX compliance), taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator in December 2004. The increase in loan expense was primarily due to the additional amortization of costs related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement, costs related to obtaining consents to modify the covenant packages of our senior unsecured notes and costs related to senior unsecured notes issued in 2003 and 2004. In May 2003, we announced the amendment and extension of our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement. The line of credit was expanded to $225,000,000 and extended to expire in May 2006 (with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants). In August 2003, we further amended the line of credit to modify certain financial covenants that enhanced our financial flexibility and aligned our covenant package with other investment-grade REITs. Finally, in December 2003 and January 2004, we expanded this line of credit to $310,000,000. In August and September 2003, we solicited the consents of registered holders of our senior unsecured notes to the adoption of certain amendments to the supplemental indentures to modify the indentures to require us to (a) limit the use of secured debt to 40% of undepreciated assets, (b) limit total debt to 60% of undepreciated total assets, and (c) maintain total unencumbered assets at 150% of total unsecured debt. These amendments to all of our then outstanding senior unsecured notes were intended to modernize the covenant package and make it consistent with other investment-grade REITs. During the year ended December 31, 2004, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $314,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value was determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party. During the year ended December 31, 2003, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of $2,792,000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value. The estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal. During the year ended December 31, 2002, it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from three properties did not exceed their related net book values and impairment charges of $2,298,000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair market values. The estimated fair market values of the properties were determined by offers to purchase received from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds. In April 2002, we purchased $35,000,000 of our outstanding senior unsecured notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of $403,000 in connection with this early extinguishment. No such transactions or charges occurred in 2003 or 2004. The provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in “Critical Accounting Policies.” Due to collectibility concerns related to portions of our loan portfolio, we increased our allowance for losses on loans receivable by an additional $1,870,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we sold properties with carrying values of $53,311,000, $61,316,000 and $37,710,000 for net losses of $1,032,000, net gains of $4,139,000 and net losses of $143,000, respectively. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We adopted the standard effective January 1, 2002. In accordance with Statement No. 144, we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2002 to discontinued operations. These properties generated $7,207,000, $4,088,000 and $641,000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Please refer to Note 15 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares. We issued 3,000,000 shares of 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May 1998, and 3,000,000 shares of 9.0% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock in January 1999. We issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in July 2003 and used the proceeds to redeem our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock. We issued 7,000,000 shares of 7.625% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock converted 900,000 shares into 878,049 shares of our common stock, leaving 2,100,000 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the holder of our Series C Preferred Stock converted 2,100,000 shares into 2,048,781 shares of our common stock, leaving no such shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. We issued 1,060,000 shares of 6% Series E Cumulative Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock in September 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted 229,556 shares into 175,714 shares of our common stock, leaving 830,444 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, certain holders of our Series E Preferred Stock converted 480,399 shares into 367,724 shares of our common stock, leaving 350,045 of such shares outstanding at December 31, 2004. As noted above, in July 2003, we closed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. A portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3,000,000 shares of our 8.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on July 15, 2003. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Topic D-42, the costs to issue these securities were recorded as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $2,790,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders. No such transactions or charges occurred in 2002 or 2004.
